<p>You don't have to have extensive programming experience, but <em>some </em>programming experience will help. Take a poke around some of the resources we have included in this site, but otherwise show up with an open mind and looking to learn something. We will do some quick icebreaker activities to help with group formation, so just be honest about your skills and what you can contribute. </p>
<p>You can take a look at the <a href='https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/46341/pages/about-the-final-presentations-and-judging?module_item_id=1420261' data-api-endpoint='https://ubc.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/46341/pages/about-the-final-presentations-and-judging' data-api-returntype='Page'>rubric</a> that we will be using  for 'judging'. Notice, technical excellence and implementation are only 1/3 of the total score. We are also looking for novel projects, and projects that have the potential to positively impact the student experience. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>I am curious as to how would the teams be formed. Would it be based on individual skillset?  Should we team up on our own after the morning session?  </p>
