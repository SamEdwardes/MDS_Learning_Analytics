3,i guys my post was removed on orrormath so i am posting here how would you guys go about tutoring and improving the math of 912 year olds,to give a little bit of my background about myself i am an 18 year old community college freshmen who throughout high school obtained straight cs in math i am taking calculus and decided that i would no longer let math be a weakness of mine and decided to go to the math tutoring center for as much time as i could everyday i would go fairly often but still failed my first test despite putting in 20 hours i did not get discouraged i reminded myself that my class drops the lowest test and that i would simply have to keep putting in more effort by the second test i had clocked in over 100 hours in the tutoring center and had done long hours of math at home on the second test i got an 87 due to missing a simple rate of change derivative problem by substituting when i shouldnt have  i realized that if i hadnt had the tutoring center at school i would have failed math seeing the attitudes of my little cousins towards math reminds me of the unhelpful attitude that i had towards the subject my whole life they view it as a complicated series of numbers and one of them actually thinks that it is uncool to like or be good at math and that it is only for nerds the other 2 simply have never experienced success in the subject  the reason that i was able to learn calculus fairly well despite having a very weak base in algebra geometry trig etc is because i hung out with these tutors the tutors can only get their job if they get an a in the class so i asked all of them for their advice on what i should do and i took all of it one of them suggested that i read and try to understand the whole book cover to cover which i am doing another suggested doing all of the red problems in the book to improve my understanding past the basics another suggested that i show all of my work thoroughly so that i would never have to fear making mistakes and to check each step constantly when i first started and wasnt able to get anything right without a tutor next to me a tutor told me that i would need to struggle through problems and only get help when i had a real question she told me that math is not a spectator sport and that the only way i was going to learn is by doing it every day i would learn some new math concept from a algebra or geometry precalc or trig that i was unaware of before and i loved the process of learning and the way it was explained i read thishttpsororgithubcomorkyryloorcourseramathematicalthinkingorblobormasterorlecture0orbackgroundreadingwhatismathematicspdf which changed my perception a lot as well  i would try every problem and when i got the problem wrong i would ask the tutor why and they would explain the trigonometry and algebra in ways i have never thought of before and it would make perfect sense i no longer viewed math as a bunch of formulas and numbers but finally had a solid understanding of what they all meant and was disappointed that i was unable to learn this in high school i might be wrong or maybe i just wasnt listening or was just lazy but i think that math in high school was not taught nearly as well as in college  i have three younger cousins that i plan on tutoring they are all having major problems in school due to math and their home life is pretty bad i always treat them as best as i can since i know that they are usually treated poorly so i do think that they would enjoy spending time with me even if it is math to them it is not exciting my plan is to have them struggle through their math problems and explain why the numbers work the way they do in the most cogent and visual way possible i plan on having them take frequent breaks to avoid burnout and will probably have them do 15 hours of math each time i see them including the breaks i also plan on trying to introduce 1 basic concept from algebra every time after they have mastered their school work accompanied by very basic problems with that concept in order to familiarize them with the material ahead of time i will be using thishttporormsenux2redwoodseduorprealgtextorchapter1pdf text book to teach very basic algebra concepts and definitions slowly maybe 1 basic concept or definition each time that i see them  andx200b  the oldest 12 does not want to learn math and it is sad to me because i know that she will most likely regret it down the road and while she is smart her dislike of school is only going to set her up for failure she has already started skipping classes their parents and all of their brothers and sisters ended up dropping out of high school and either getting pregnant at 15or16 or doing hard drugs they now suffer from depression and anxiety live extremely unhealthy lifestyles and struggle to hold onto jobs i really do not want these little girls to end up like their parents when they get older and the only way that i could see them often and be a positive influence on their lives is through math  there is a fine line between making math imposing and making math fun or bearable and i am going to have to be very careful walking across that line  it is obvious to me that the youngest one 9 has a learning disability and she is constantly made fun of for being dumb by her immediate family and i am worried that she will develop self esteem issues because of it for her i plan on teaching in a more kinesthetic way which if you have any ideas as to how to do i would love to hear it i am thinking of using an abacus and maybe even a game of catch  as per the middle child she actually wants help with math and is fairly intelligent i will need to approach the subject differently with all 3 of them and was wondering if you guys had any ideas as to how to do this more specifically,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dqnmq6/i_guys_my_post_was_removed_on_rmath_so_i_am/,i guys my post was removed on orrormath so i am posting here how would you guys go about tutoring and improving the math of 912 year olds to give a little bit of my background about myself i am an 18 year old community college freshmen who throughout high school obtained straight cs in math i am taking calculus and decided that i would no longer let math be a weakness of mine and decided to go to the math tutoring center for as much time as i could everyday i would go fairly often but still failed my first test despite putting in 20 hours i did not get discouraged i reminded myself that my class drops the lowest test and that i would simply have to keep putting in more effort by the second test i had clocked in over 100 hours in the tutoring center and had done long hours of math at home on the second test i got an 87 due to missing a simple rate of change derivative problem by substituting when i shouldnt have  i realized that if i hadnt had the tutoring center at school i would have failed math seeing the attitudes of my little cousins towards math reminds me of the unhelpful attitude that i had towards the subject my whole life they view it as a complicated series of numbers and one of them actually thinks that it is uncool to like or be good at math and that it is only for nerds the other 2 simply have never experienced success in the subject  the reason that i was able to learn calculus fairly well despite having a very weak base in algebra geometry trig etc is because i hung out with these tutors the tutors can only get their job if they get an a in the class so i asked all of them for their advice on what i should do and i took all of it one of them suggested that i read and try to understand the whole book cover to cover which i am doing another suggested doing all of the red problems in the book to improve my understanding past the basics another suggested that i show all of my work thoroughly so that i would never have to fear making mistakes and to check each step constantly when i first started and wasnt able to get anything right without a tutor next to me a tutor told me that i would need to struggle through problems and only get help when i had a real question she told me that math is not a spectator sport and that the only way i was going to learn is by doing it every day i would learn some new math concept from a algebra or geometry precalc or trig that i was unaware of before and i loved the process of learning and the way it was explained i read thishttpsororgithubcomorkyryloorcourseramathematicalthinkingorblobormasterorlecture0orbackgroundreadingwhatismathematicspdf which changed my perception a lot as well  i would try every problem and when i got the problem wrong i would ask the tutor why and they would explain the trigonometry and algebra in ways i have never thought of before and it would make perfect sense i no longer viewed math as a bunch of formulas and numbers but finally had a solid understanding of what they all meant and was disappointed that i was unable to learn this in high school i might be wrong or maybe i just wasnt listening or was just lazy but i think that math in high school was not taught nearly as well as in college  i have three younger cousins that i plan on tutoring they are all having major problems in school due to math and their home life is pretty bad i always treat them as best as i can since i know that they are usually treated poorly so i do think that they would enjoy spending time with me even if it is math to them it is not exciting my plan is to have them struggle through their math problems and explain why the numbers work the way they do in the most cogent and visual way possible i plan on having them take frequent breaks to avoid burnout and will probably have them do 15 hours of math each time i see them including the breaks i also plan on trying to introduce 1 basic concept from algebra every time after they have mastered their school work accompanied by very basic problems with that concept in order to familiarize them with the material ahead of time i will be using thishttporormsenux2redwoodseduorprealgtextorchapter1pdf text book to teach very basic algebra concepts and definitions slowly maybe 1 basic concept or definition each time that i see them  andx200b  the oldest 12 does not want to learn math and it is sad to me because i know that she will most likely regret it down the road and while she is smart her dislike of school is only going to set her up for failure she has already started skipping classes their parents and all of their brothers and sisters ended up dropping out of high school and either getting pregnant at 15or16 or doing hard drugs they now suffer from depression and anxiety live extremely unhealthy lifestyles and struggle to hold onto jobs i really do not want these little girls to end up like their parents when they get older and the only way that i could see them often and be a positive influence on their lives is through math  there is a fine line between making math imposing and making math fun or bearable and i am going to have to be very careful walking across that line  it is obvious to me that the youngest one 9 has a learning disability and she is constantly made fun of for being dumb by her immediate family and i am worried that she will develop self esteem issues because of it for her i plan on teaching in a more kinesthetic way which if you have any ideas as to how to do i would love to hear it i am thinking of using an abacus and maybe even a game of catch  as per the middle child she actually wants help with math and is fairly intelligent i will need to approach the subject differently with all 3 of them and was wondering if you guys had any ideas as to how to do this more specifically

11,math and i were enemies  a message to math teachers everywhere,during my entire scholastic career i hated math it wasnt that i hated school although i believed this until the second half of high school i didnt hate learning i loved history and science  i just hated math and i hated homework i was convinced that id be working within the music industry the second i graduated high school rockstars dont do homework math never got anyone a record deal incredibly naive and stupid i know but what else do you expect from a 16yearold i did go on to go to school for audio engineering which exposed me to the sick truth that there was indeed math in music despite making the deans list during my first two semesters i was unsuccessful in finishing my degree financial aid issues combined with a failed class im here to tell you that two years later ive decided to hop back on the horse    i recently applied to a forestry program that requires tabe testing while a lot of the sites ive been using are a bit janky  i have been slowly but surely begun to learn the operations i daydreamed through all those years ago at first i didnt run into any issues everything was easy until it wasnt the first question i got wrong was an eyeopener i was reminded of how math made me feel all those years ago it made me feel stupid i was angry at first it was funny because i hadnt experienced such kneejerk rage since school it was almost like the scene from its always sunny where mack flips the board in chardeemacdennis then i was disappointed in myself for failing at something a grade school child could complete but where i wouldve just said screw it xbox time as a kid or teenager i decided to continue it also made me realize that a lot of the teachers i had in the past were good mathematicians but terrible math teachers   i cant tell you how many times in high school and college i heard the words  do you guys get it pretty easy right always met by dead air and two or three head nods from the gifted kids if you tell someone something is easy and they dont understand it you make them feel stupid and discourage inquisition while it may be a pretty rudimentary concept the people in a class are there because they dont know the subject being taught of course its easy for a dr in their respective fields theyve been studying it most of their lives and have been teaching it for several years most people who arent inclined in math dont study it therefore if youre teaching it youre more than likely somewhat mathematically gifted   as someone who has the math skills of a seventhgrader ive got to tell you that math is pretty fun once you understand what youre doing i was disappointed in the fact that i couldnt do long division two or three problems and it all came back to me subtracting decimals was another one i understood how to subtract anything that resulted in a positive integer but anything that was supposed to result in a negative was always off after some frustration and anger that i couldnt direct at anything other than myselformy brain i realized that if i swapped the places of the larger integer and just subtracted like normal and reverse the sign id get the answer the calculator displayed mild extasy  i beat the numbers i knew the operation and id never let a similar one make me feel dumb again im disappointed as to why i couldnt do this before probably because i didnt have the emotional maturity to continue when the option is frustration rage then disappointment or videogames its an easy choice   my message is this dont take your natural inclinations for granted and dont try to tell people math is simple to them its not if you truly want to help children who struggled the way i did do one unconventional thing weaponize their disdain convince them to defeat the numbers you may love math but the ones who are struggling despise it it makes us feel dumb encourage people to make math their bitch   conquering ones ignorance is

isn’t a fan of the company and was ready to leave but told me he wouldn’t leave the company til i was a “top dog” fitter like him the first thing he taught me to read was the blueprints i was a stud at this because when breaking things down it all becomes very simple addition and subtraction and ability to read x y z direction so this was a breeze to me but the pipefitting hand son portion was not so easy but after a couple of months of getting the basics down he began to show me tricks tricks that any person who remembers anything about geometry from high school would be able to look at and instantly begin applying that knowledge to real life things like diameter radius and circumference of a circle i couldn’t tell you how many times i asked myself why i should care so much about circles and measuring them   as time flies i begin realizing that i’ve gotten the grasp of pipefitting so my fitter tests me out to see if i can do it at first things are shaky but eventually i get it

247,how do i calculate my parasitic alien colonys expansion rate,   greetings earthlings  so  i just invented a parasitic lifeform designed to eradicate all life on  planet earth as you do but ran into aproblem and since almost an  intire percent of your inteligent population is quite adiquite at  mathematics i figured i might as well save my mental exersion by  asking you guys for help   the  life forms in question come in several species dont know witch one  ill use yet teehee3 species 01 aka murderblobs reproduces  asexually by cloning itself every few years and each clone once  formed takes a few years to reach sexual maturity i currently have the  reproductive cloning interval set to once a year and the time needed  to reach sexuall maturaty set to 7 years though i might change that so  i need to be able to acount for such changes  then  theres the second species oh boy species 03 aka bloodapes ii  electric boogaloo reproduces through male to female sexuall intercores  i know disgusting right currently the bloodapes2 can breed only  once a year due to a 1 year long pregnancy once born the bloodape  will take 7 years to reach sexuall maturity for both males and  females its a 50or50 wether the offspring is a male or a female and  same as with the musrerblobs certen details might change such as the  pregnancy duration sexual maturation and male to female birth ratio  the  third species is almost as disgusting species 05 aka deathpuppies  reproduces through male to female sexuall intercorce   same as with  the bloodapes2 the deathpuppies can breed only once a year due to a 1  year long pregnancy once born the ofspring will take 7 years to reach  sexuall maturaty the thing with this species though is they cant give  birth to males and with todays current spacegass prices i cant  really send more than two specimens so the male i send over in the  initial pod will be the only male in the colony at least untill i can  save up enough spacebucks to send a second male the other issue is that  one male can only ejaculate once every 6 secounds and needs atleast 2  hours of sleep per day so eventually there are going to be so many  females that not all of them will get a chance to breed each year i  need to know how long it will take before i have to send a second male  also  my time frame might change how many 01s can i get in 50 or 100 years  how long will it take to get one milion 03s there are other possible  variations as well what if they get some weird mutations like twins or  liking pineapple on pizza how do i acount for mortality rates or  existencial questions  so in  short i would aprechiate if you guys would share your proces for how  you calculate parasitecolony expansion rates since i heard that you  got one of your lesser parasitic species to consider a mars colony it  was the humans wasnt it i bet you dolphins are pretty stoked  with that xd  ps assuming you send 1 human male and 1 human female what would the equation look like  pps  is it true that this h2o stuff contains oxygen i need to know because  all the species i created are extremly inbred and therefore deathly  allergic to oxygen  much love from your

one male can only ejaculate once every 6 secounds and needs atleast 2  hours of sleep per day so eventually there are going to be so many  females that not all of them will get a chance to breed each year i  need to know how long it will take before i have to send a second male  also  my time frame might change how many 01s can i get in 50 or 100 years  how long will it take to get one milion 03s there are other possible  variations as well what if they get some weird mutations like twins or  liking pineapple on pizza how do i acount for mortality rates or  existencial questions  so in  short i would aprechiate if you guys would share your proces for how  you calculate parasitecolony expansion rates since i heard that you  got one of your lesser parasitic species to consider a mars colony it  was the humans wasnt it i bet you dolphins are pretty stoked  with that xd  ps assuming you send 1 human male and 1 human female what would the equation look like  pps  is it true that this h2o stuff contains oxygen i need to know because  all the species i created are extremly inbred and therefore deathly  allergic to oxygen  much love from your friendly intergallactic space neighbor

744,im writing a fantasy story with a multitude of incredibly powerful warriors as the antagonists but im having trouble determining how many of the titular dreadknights exist,okay backstory time  in my story dreadknights the year was 2100 ad or close to that time when humanity has been driven into a vast shelter dug out 2 miles underground  this shelter is known as the terraplex and its purpose is to give humanity the only chance to survive against the niraut the niruat are a multitude of magical creatures created by jazan the star god of unholy dreams to wipe out all life on earth and consume all of its energy  but the terraplex has another purpose for just as satan isnt in the ground in this universe god wasnt in the sky gaia temporary name is rising from the earth to give humanity a fighting chance against him but gaia knew that jazans assault was too fast for her to make it in time  so gaia instructed a number of human nations to build terraplexes two miles under the surface so she may give them magic the thing is that in order for a god to give a sentient creature magical abilities they have to appear before them in a body that can be touched this is where the problem arises gaia is so entrenched in our world and fueling life that itll take thousands of years for her to be close enough to the surface to do so and by that time humanity would be long gone  so she messaged several human nations to dig 2 miles underground and build the terraplexes where they would wait until gaia kept her promise and gave them magic americas terraplex was the only one able to be completed in time  and so for 4202 years the human race has remained in the last city nova sanctum as a race of only 10000 individuals the terraplex can sustain little above that  a thousand years after they were sealed in gaia appeared and kept her promise all of the humans of the terraplex entered a pact with her that allowed them to use gaias power to do magicand the descendants of those who made the pact but gaia knew this was not enough  nova sanctum is surrounded by a vast desolate rocky cave filled with interconnected pools of water known as the verge gaia gave the humans another commandment  when glowing marks spiralling all over your body appear you will know that you are worthy of earning even greater power the power needed to defeat the niraut when the marks appear go into the verge and drown in the biggest of these pools of water which i dub the lake of sublimity and you when you emerge you will be unharmed unable to die from asphyxiation will have great power and be beyond the ravages of time  but this power was not sufficient for the humans to succeed gaia levitated her physical form over the lake of sublimity then turned into a pile of rocks and fell in the center and the lake of sublimity and every drop of water connected to it was consecrated as holy water lethal to the touch for all niraut but for the creatures of earth it possesses unparalleled healing properties soon the verge began to fill with life and became an ecosystem of glowing plants fungi and insects but lets stop there  there are 10000 humans alive for that 3202 years and outside of that number there are only a thousand of the titular dreadknights awake during that time whenever the number of dreadknights reaches a certain point 1500 one hundred of the elder dreadknights must enter the pools of holy water and sleep in it there they will remain perfectly preserved awaiting the day they are called upon to retake the surface  every 20 years 100 dreadknights on average are chosen from the general populace are declared worthy marked many from young children and that number is spread out across those 20 years so how many dreadknights would be created from a population of

882,combinatorics how many strings composed of only 012 contain exactly three 1s,part 1 so if the question was instead asking about bit strings ie strings made up of only 1s and 0s then i calculated the answer to be 12choose3 because we could choose the positions of the 1s and we know the rest of the positions would be filled by 0s  part 2 but now lets say the other positions can be filled with 0s or 2s now what is the answer it seems like it should be much larger than 12choose3 but im not sure  right off the bat i think that there is more than twice as many possible strings because for each string that was possible in part 1 we can get another string except replacing every 2 with a 0 except we can also mix and match 2s and 0s and im not sure how to account for that  any help is appreciated,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dkke12/combinatorics_how_many_strings_composed_of_only/,combinatorics how many strings composed of only 012 contain exactly three 1s part 1 so if the question was instead asking about bit strings ie strings made up of only 1s and 0s then i calculated the answer to be 12choose3 because we could choose the positions of the 1s and we know the rest of the positions would be filled by 0s  part 2 but now lets say the other positions can be filled with 0s or 2s now what is the answer it seems like it should be much larger than 12choose3 but im not sure  right off the bat i think that there is more than twice as many possible strings because for each string that was possible in part 1 we can get another string except replacing every 2 with a 0 except we can also mix and match 2s and 0s and im not sure how to account for that  any help is appreciated

934,math professors how to ask for help,crossposting from roraskacademia incase anyone here has some input as this definitely still pertains to learning math  hello thank you for taking the time to read this  im in a bit of an uncomfortable and disheartening situation and im looking for some advice on how best to proceed this is a bit of a long read so im sorry but im feeling extremely extremely discouraged and would like some honest input from capable individuals in the field i would post to the professors sub but im not certain theyd like another student invading their virtual lounge without invitation so hopefully here will work i really need some help  alright so  im currently a firstyear undergraduate student in the math and physical sciences stream of my university firstyears do not yet have formal programs but are instead in one of several streams of study they apply to programs at the end of their firstyear  my university experience has been a trying one thus far i was admitted with a nice scholarship upon application and was supposed to have been a thirdyear student by now but due to mental and physical health issues i ended up taking an incomplete courseload my first official year then having to take a leave of absence the second and only now am i back and still a first year  im now properly registered with the accessibility services at my school and at their advice and that of academic advisors am starting with a partial courseload to try to learn how to be a functioning student and individual living on my own for the first time and really until yesterday evening i was doing pretty okay my mental health is very much not good and im waiting on specialists and doing things in the meantime to try to sort things out but things are difficult i have a lot of difficulty with executive functioning skills despite this i am doing exceptionally well in my language course and was doing well in my math course keyword being was  the math course that im in is the one designated for students who have an interest in math but arent certain they wish to pursue it or are in the physical or computer sciences or who may not have the necessary prerequisite knowledgeormaturity to take the higherlevel math course our first term test was yesterday and it covered introductory logic notation quantifiers formal limits continuity epsilondelta proofs and things of that sort i did really well on the assignments prior to this test they were a little challenging but given time and the ability to ask questions i performed very very well and thought i understood the material reasonably well ive been going to office hours speaking with my professor after lectures and doublechecking that my proofs are wellwritten and that my approaches are correct my relationship with math has been difficult in the past mostly because of the disappointing math curriculum and teaching standard where i live students are taught to memorize and never question why or how things work and that led me to a lot of frustration despite never doing poorly in my math classes i feel like my foundational math is not as solid as it could be that i never really did as well as i could and that maybe i still have some unresolved emotional issues there but for the first time as i began this course and saw how capable and enthusiastic my instructors are as i started to find the content interesting and even enjoyable epsilon delta proofs are like satisfying little puzzle minigames and doing well i began to think that maybe just maybe i could be good at this maybe i could be a math student maybe  but then the term test came yesterday and wow i dont even know what to say i did all the practice problems reviewed all the videos did the tutorials clarified my questions and thought things would hopefully be fine all the signs suggested things would be fine then i started the test and it may as well have been written in inuktitut i could hardly make sense of anything i couldnt remember how to prove statements how to reason through rough work determining limits of compositions from a graph how does that work i was so anxious i could hardly think and i honestly cannot tell you whether i failed that test or by some miracle pulled and 80 or something and i dont know when well have our marks back i dont even want to look at it when we do get it back i feel physically ill about my performance on this test i spent a good amount of time crying last night  i have to be honest and say that im not used to doing poorly or to have any significant struggle understanding things courses like biology and chemistry and everything else have come easily and intuitively and despite having arguably one of the worst periods of my life at the time i still managed to finish with above 95 in them but math i feel so slow so stupid so abysmally stupid things dont come as quickly in fact they come quite slowly too slowly i did really well on the problem sets but now im just wondering if i faked my way into that because apparently i dont understand that much at all if that test was anything to go by maybe im incapable of doing things on my own i dont even know if it will be possible for me to finish with above a 90 in this course now which while i recognize that grades are not necessarily the most important qualifier or anything i would like to pursue some form of graduate schooling so a decent academic record is preferable  just last week my professor was telling me theyd be happy to speak to me more about pursuing math and we were maybe starting to develop a slightly friendlier relationship and now i dont think i can even look them in the eye i must seem so stupid its worth questioning whether i even belong in this course i know that they say math is a discipline where hard work surpasses talent but even then i think natural aptitude is important to some degree and im starting to question whether i actually have any how can i even ask them for help when just last week i was dumb enough to admit i was just slightly considering math  im tired of running away from my failures throughout the past couple of years though so i really want the chance to repair this if only out of stubbornness i want the opportunity to conquer this material and understand it to devour it until it becomes like breathing and maybe give math the chance i never truly gave it before the chance i didnt give myself before i intend to speak to my professor on monday and ask for help or guidance but i dont know how to go about doing so what do i tell them how much do i tell them i feel like whatever potential i had when i was younger shriveled up and died the day my mental health decided it was time to mutate im already a disappointment and i dont know whether to be honest about my past here no one knows except the relevant counselors and advisors here and its kind of isolating but probably for the best i really wanted to develop a good relationship with this professor maybe impress them on some minute level to not just be some random student sitting in the lecture hall but really im scared that theyll think im actually certifiably stupid im still nervous to ask them questions when there is something i dont quite fully grasp to answer their questions and be wrong i thought about speaking to one of the other course professors instead who im less nervous around might be better so that i can actually ask questions but this is the one for my lecture section and theyre a very impressive individual and i want to learn everything i can from them i just dont want to be stupid or a disappointment or annoyance  so yeah  i might like math i might not i might not be adept at it but i want the chance to be given my previous decent performance and likely disastrous test how do i approach my professor who im kind of intimidated by just going up to them and being like hi that test was a dumpster fire please take me under your wing and teach me everything you know is probably a bit much to dump on someone ive known for less than two months when i dont even know whether i should be studying math  im really
