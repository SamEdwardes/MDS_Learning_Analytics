370601,What number generators do slot machines use?,"Hash algorithms have progressed over the years, ranging from MD5 to SHA256 to bcrypt, scrypt, and argon2. Algorithms are designed to be hard to read, with older ones being easier to predict.

I've heard stories about people watching and analyzing slot machines and trying to snipe jackpots from them, and I'm curious to what extent these stories are true, and if manufacturers WANT the machines to be exploitable. The most obvious answer would be no, they don't want anyone rigging the game. But of course, if a slot machine CAN be gained but it happens to be hard to do so, more people will try (and fail) to gain the system, thus increasing revenue for the manufacturer. For something like this, you might want something that's NOT cryptographically secure, like MD5 or even Mersenne Twister.

But all of this is conjecture. What do slot machines ACTUALLY use to generate outcomes, and are they made to be difficult or actually impossible to predict? I assume modern machines will have their implementation closely guarded but surely people have detailed information on machines from like 20 years ago?",https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/46341/discussion_topics/370601

Ask us anything!","When did humans first begin transforming this planet? Our recent article in [*Science*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax1192) brings together more than 250 archaeologists to weigh in on this. By mapping human use of land over the past 10,000 years, we show that human transformation of Earth began much earlier than previously recognized, deepening scientific understanding of the Anthropocene, the age of humans. We're here to answer your questions about this 10,000-year history and how we mapped it.

You wouldn't be able to implant it into womb and cause a pregnancy, so it hasn't *fully* de-differentiated, right?

Can you fully de-differentiate a differentiated cell, at least in theory, so that it effectively becomes a zygote? Or is there some theoretical limitation to this?

Further, they can quantum tunnel, making it possible for their release. Why can't Fe, the most stable nucleus on a per-nucleon basis, be emitted in a manner similar to alpha decay? Is it just unlikely because it has an enormous coulomb barrier?

But one detail I am not clear on is why a low thermal output (200mw), in itself, would make an accident more likely. The book states that the thermal output of the reactor during the backup power test was meant to be between 700 and 1000mw, but one of the people supervising the test insisted that the reactor's thermal output be brought down to 200mw. The book speculates that this person insisted on the lower thermal output because he assumed it would be safer, and to my (layman's) mind, this seems to make sense. 

As it happened, due to operator error, the thermal output of the reactor dropped to around 30mw, leading to xenon poisoning in the reactor. To bring the reactor back up to 200mw, virtually all of the control rods in the reactor were manually removed and numerous automatic failsafes were overridden. Supposing instead that the reactor was gradually brought down from its normal operating level to 200mw, could something still have gone wrong owing only to the low thermal output?",https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/46341/discussion_topics/370533

370519,Why is equipartition of energy expected in the modes of a resonant cavity? And why this should model a solid radiator?,"I think the answer for this may be straightforward, but I don't see anywhere that explains this from the scratch:  


A large resonant cavity with a small hole is used to approximate an ideal black body.   


I understand the conditions for the modes inside the cavity. But there are two points that aren't clear to me:  


1) I don't understand why it was considered that the energy should be equipartitioned between those modes. Because I don't see a reason why they couldn't be independent.   


At least not if it was ideally reflecting body inside. In that case, just like in ideal vibrating  stings, there could be no exchange of energy between the modes and the spectrum of the light inside it would be just like the spectrum of the light entering it.  


I think the story has to do with the body not being perfectly reflecting and being in equilibrium with the modes inside the cavity. But even then: Why couldn't it just stay in equilibrium with the modes that has already being formed by the light that entered the cavity? Is the equipartition being mediated by the material portion of the cavity?

370475,Can someone explain the spontaneity of time symmetry breaking in the Lukin and Monroe time crystal experiments?,"As I understand it:
In both experiments, there was a drive (lasers in Monroe's, microwave pulses in Lukin's) that causes a change in spin state of a system (Monroe: a chain of ytterbium ions; Lukin: defects in a diamond). In both cases, the spin states of these systems revert back to their original state. However, the drives were periodically applied, and the resulting spin state oscillation did not match the periodicity of the drive, but oscillated at 1/2 or 1/3 the frequency.

(I may have misunderstood this - I'm a biologist, not a physicist. Please correct me if so).

What I don't understand is - if the periodicity of these systems is a result of the periodicity of the drive, and not a product of the systems themselves under specific conditions, why is this *spontaneous* breaking of time symmetry?",https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/46341/discussion_topics/370475

370470,"What is the difference between ""Newtonian"" and ""isotropic"" in fluid mechanics?","In my intermediate fluid mechanics course, the viscous stress tensor was introduced, with associated expressions for each shear stress. I realized that, just as with solid mechanics, the viscosity could vary with direction in an anisotropic substance; however, when I asked the professor about the possibility of Newtonian anisotropic fluids, I was told that that this normally does not occur (that is, ""Newtonian"" implies ""isotropic""). 

However, this does not correspond with my understanding of the two concepts. My impression is that ""Newtonian"" implies a viscosity that is independent of the applied shear stress (that is, not having any description of spatial dependence), while ""isotropic"" implies that properties are invariant regardless of the direction of travel.

My question is: Why did the Xenon get burned off in just these crucial seconds? Xenon burnoff is proportional to neutron flow, which again is proportional to reactor power. Sure, reactor power did increase in these seconds, but even if we assume a reactor power of 10 GW during these 10 seconds, the total burnoff should have been the same as would have happened, if the previous level of 200 MW had been kept for an additional 500 seconds, i.e. eight minutes.

So, did the Xenon concentration by a stroke of ridiculously bad luck sink below some important threshold just during the power excursion? Or was the Xenon poisoning's importance simply that it forced the crew do conduct their test under otherwise extremely volatile operating conditions, and its contribution to the actual accident was negligible?",https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/46341/discussion_topics/370469

Since neutrinos have an incredibly tiny mass compared to other particles, does this mean that sterile neutrinos, which are the opposite of normal neutrinos, are the same thing as heavy neutrinos as they’re opposite so the opposite of a tiny mass particle is a heavy mass particle. Also, I also learnt that the value of the Hubble constant has conflicting data taken from 3 different sources, each being the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, the afterglow of the Big Bang, Type 1a Supernovae, when a white dwarf takes matter from a larger star that it in a binary pair with it until it explodes, and Quasars, black holes with extremely bright accretion disks. He said that this shows that, if all the results are taken properly, this shows that the Cosmological Constant is increasing over time. He also said in another video that the cause of this could be unknown physics such as a fast moving particle such as sterile neutrinos. In a third video, he says that if more neutrinos exist, such as the sterile neutrinos, then it’s evidence that the early universe would’ve expanded faster than current observational data assumes.

2. ""The bases of mountain islands are below sea level \[...\] Mauna Kea \[...\] is the world's tallest mountain...""
3. ""The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars...""

What is the base of a mountain and where is it? Are the bases of all mountains level at 0m? What about Mauna Kea? What is the equivalent level for mountains on other planets and on moons? What do you call the region or volume between the base and peak?",https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/46341/discussion_topics/370409
370408,AskScience AMA Series: We are researchers studying biological rhythms and we want to 'lock the clock' to permanently end daylight saving time - ask us anything!,"We are from the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms ([SRBR](https://srbr.org/)), an organization of international scientists, clinicians, and industry experts who promote basic and applied research in all aspects of biological rhythms. We are dedicated to advancing rigorous, peer-reviewed science and evidence-based policies related to sleep and circadian biology.

Daylight saving time (DST) in the USA ends this weekend and we support the campaign to permanently end DST for better health. You can read more about this in our position paper titled ""[Why Should We Abolish Daylight Saving Time?](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730419854197)"" that was published in the Journal of Biological Rhythms earlier this year.

Our team for today is:

+ [Dr. Laura Kervezee](https://twitter.com/Mind_the_time) - SRBR public outreach fellow &amp; researcher at Leiden University, Netherlands (shift work, circadian disruption and human health)
+ Dr. Allison Brager - Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Author of Meathead: Unraveling the Athletic Brain (sleep, circadian rhythms and behavioral neuroscience)
+ [Dr. Jonathan Cedernaes](https://twitter.com/jcedernaes) -Northwestern University, Illinois &amp; Uppsala University, Sweden (sleep, circadian rhythms, metabolic disorders)
+ [Dr. Louise Ince](https://twitter.com/LM_Ince) - University of Geneva, Switzerland (circadian rhythms and immune function)
+ [Dr. Emily Manoogian](https://twitter.com/EmilyManoogian) - Salk Institute, California (circadian rhythms, time-restricted eating)

370407,AskScience Panel of Scientists XXI,"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

       Username: /u/foretopsail
       General field: Anthropology
       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology
       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction. 
       Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.
       Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

370406,Why does biological matter make good fertilizer?,"Now hear me out. I'm not stupid. I really love learning and I know that when biological matter, like feces, breaks down, it releases alot of chemicals and elements that are good for plants. I also know that most, if not all, life on Earth need these chemicals and stuff to survive. 

My question is why? Why are these chemicals released by our waste and why are they so good for plants and things? 

Basically, I know they need them, but I don't quite understand the exact reasoning.",https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/46341/discussion_topics/370406
