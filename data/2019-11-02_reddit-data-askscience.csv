0,AskScience Panel of Scientists XXI,"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

I really love learning and I know that when biological matter, like feces, breaks down, it releases alot of chemicals and elements that are good for plants.

11,Does everything in the universe pull on everything else in the universe?,My high school physics teacher told my class that we all pull on everything in the universe. Today I was curious how long it takes for gravity to travel to objects and I looked it up on google and was told that it moves at the speed of light. But I also have been told that space is expanding faster than the speed of light.

12,Why don’t hotspots in the earths mantle move with the continental plates?,"I’m currently taking a geomorphology class in college and we were talking about plate tectonics.

15,Is there a connection between PPP and schizophrenia in women? How do therapists determine which diagnosis is correct for a specific woman?,"Basically women tend to develop schizophrenia later than men, in their mid to late 20s. This is also around the time that a lot of women start their family's. How do therapists determine if it is PPP (postpartum psychosis) or schizophrenia (or something else)? Plenty of women with PPD (postpartum depression) don't get diagnosis or treatment until quite a while after they have given birth so I don't think the time frame of the illness is necessarily a reliable indicator of which the woman is suffering from.

Do you think there is a lot of misdiagnosis? How does treatment vary between the two illnesses? If the PPP is resistant to therapy does the diagnosis get changed to schizophrenia? Also if a woman has a history of schizophrenia in her family is she more prone to PPP? 

Have any official studies been conducted into this, and if not what is your opinion?",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dqbsy5/is_there_a_connection_between_ppp_and/
16,Are sterile neutrinos responsible for the discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements and are sterile neutrinos and heavy neutrinos the same thing?,"So I was watching PBS Space Time and neutrinos was a topic and the presenter Matt O’Dowd said that physicists have only discovered left handed neutrinos and right handed antineutrinos. Since neutrinos have an incredibly tiny mass compared to other particles, does this mean that sterile neutrinos, which are the opposite of normal neutrinos, are the same thing as heavy neutrinos as they’re opposite so the opposite of a tiny mass particle is a heavy mass particle. Also, I also learnt that the value of the Hubble constant has conflicting data taken from 3 different sources, each being the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, the afterglow of the Big Bang, Type 1a Supernovae, when a white dwarf takes matter from a larger star that it in a binary pair with it until it explodes, and Quasars, black holes with extremely bright accretion disks. He said that this shows that, if all the results are taken properly, this shows that the Cosmological Constant is increasing over time. He also said in another video that the cause of this could be unknown physics such as a fast moving particle such as sterile neutrinos. In a third video, he says that if more neutrinos exist, such as the sterile neutrinos, then it’s evidence that the early universe would’ve expanded faster than current observational data assumes. So does this mean that sterile neutrinos are the answer to this discrepancy and if not then what is?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dqenn3/are_sterile_neutrinos_responsible_for_the/
17,Can you harvest the spin energy of an object? Can objects be spun up in 0 gravity to serve as batteries?,"An object that is in motion stays in motion right, so if you were to spin a huge object really fast, and then use a machine to harvest that rotational momentum when energy is needed, could you not spin up an object in space and leave it spinning for as long as you want until you're ready to use its energy? Could spinning objects serve as simple batteries? Is it viable to harvest energy from a spinning object?

I posted this yesterday BTW and got 0 replies. AskScience is dying I think, or maybe just over-moderated. I'd be open to suggestions to alternative boards.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dq7itx/can_you_harvest_the_spin_energy_of_an_object_can/

30,"What, scientifically, makes hills suboptimal locations for farming?","When I read about history, it seems clear that hills are not very good for farming compared to flat land. Especially in Europe, hills and mountains seem to be reserved for tribes or poor populations who were not wealthy or powerful enough to occupy better farmable land for themselves.


I tried searching on Google about what exactly makes uneven land so bad for farming, but all I found were articles about modern hill farming and terrace farms, none of which really answers what I want to know.

59,Were the Chernobyl operators just really unlucky in regards to the Xenon burnoff?,"We have all seen that tv scene, where Legasov explained what went on in the last seconds of reactor 4: The feed water was shut off, the uncooled water boiled away (increasing reactivity), the Xenon got burned off (increasing reactivity even more), and finally the insertion of the control rods let the reactor go promptly supercritical (i.e.: ""boom"").

My question is: Why did the Xenon get burned off in just these crucial seconds? Xenon burnoff is proportional to neutron flow, which again is proportional to reactor power. Sure, reactor power did increase in these seconds, but even if we assume a reactor power of 10 GW during these 10 seconds, the total burnoff should have been the same as would have happened, if the previous level of 200 MW had been kept for an additional 500 seconds, i.e. eight minutes.

So, did the Xenon concentration by a stroke of ridiculously bad luck sink below some important threshold just during the power excursion? Or was the Xenon poisoning's importance simply that it forced the crew do conduct their test under otherwise extremely volatile operating conditions, and its contribution to the actual accident was negligible?",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dpgyd5/were_the_chernobyl_operators_just_really_unlucky/
60,"What is the difference between ""Newtonian"" and ""isotropic"" in fluid mechanics?","In my intermediate fluid mechanics course, the viscous stress tensor was introduced, with associated expressions for each shear stress. I realized that, just as with solid mechanics, the viscosity could vary with direction in an anisotropic substance; however, when I asked the professor about the possibility of Newtonian anisotropic fluids, I was told that that this normally does not occur (that is, ""Newtonian"" implies ""isotropic""). 

However, this does not correspond with my understanding of the two concepts. My impression is that ""Newtonian"" implies a viscosity that is independent of the applied shear stress (that is, not having any description of spatial dependence), while ""isotropic"" implies that properties are invariant regardless of the direction of travel.

65,Can someone explain the spontaneity of time symmetry breaking in the Lukin and Monroe time crystal experiments?,"As I understand it:
In both experiments, there was a drive (lasers in Monroe's, microwave pulses in Lukin's) that causes a change in spin state of a system (Monroe: a chain of ytterbium ions; Lukin: defects in a diamond). In both cases, the spin states of these systems revert back to their original state. However, the drives were periodically applied, and the resulting spin state oscillation did not match the periodicity of the drive, but oscillated at 1/2 or 1/3 the frequency.

(I may have misunderstood this - I'm a biologist, not a physicist. Please correct me if so).

What I don't understand is - if the periodicity of these systems is a result of the periodicity of the drive, and not a product of the systems themselves under specific conditions, why is this *spontaneous* breaking of time symmetry?",224,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/doxk82/can_someone_explain_the_spontaneity_of_time/

We  might be tempted to use our ordinary intuition about geometry, and  deduce the volume of a Schwarzschild black hole  This is, however, not necessarily the case.

The  reason is that general relativity is a geometric theory of a  four-dimensional spacetime, that is, three dimensions of space and one  dimension of time. In order to specify a spatial volume, one has to  specify a specific moment in time.*

76,How can freezing water break matter?,"I'm not sure how to put it exactly so here is a simple, ""ideal"" scenario:

If I put a bottle of water in a room and start removing heat from the room, the water will first lose its sensible heat until it gets to 0 C.

Then, the water will give up its latent heat and start freezing. Since ice is less dense than liquid water, it will start to expend in volume as well.

But if my bottle is closed, the ice will build pressure inside it until it breaks. The ice will do ""work"" on the bottle.

My question is: how could the formation of ice break the bottle if the water is already giving up energy as heat? Is there a force known as ""work energy of crystal formation"" that would explain it? How could it be explained on an atomic level?

108,Why is equipartition of energy expected in the modes of a resonant cavity? And why this should model a solid radiator?,"I think the answer for this may be straightforward, but I don't see anywhere that explains this from the scratch:  


A large resonant cavity with a small hole is used to approximate an ideal black body.   


I understand the conditions for the modes inside the cavity. But there are two points that aren't clear to me:  


1) I don't understand why it was considered that the energy should be equipartitioned between those modes. Because I don't see a reason why they couldn't be independent.   


At least not if it was ideally reflecting body inside. In that case, just like in ideal vibrating  stings, there could be no exchange of energy between the modes and the spectrum of the light inside it would be just like the spectrum of the light entering it.  


I think the story has to do with the body not being perfectly reflecting and being in equilibrium with the modes inside the cavity. But even then: Why couldn't it just stay in equilibrium with the modes that has already being formed by the light that entered the cavity? Is the equipartition being mediated by the material portion of the cavity?

122,How would the low thermal output of Chernobyl's reactor #4 on the night of the Chernobyl disaster have contributed to the reactor core's instability?,"I am currently reading the book *Midnight in Chernobyl,* and I am mostly clear on the sequence of errors that led to the Chernobyl disaster. But one detail I am not clear on is why a low thermal output (200mw), in itself, would make an accident more likely. The book states that the thermal output of the reactor during the backup power test was meant to be between 700 and 1000mw, but one of the people supervising the test insisted that the reactor's thermal output be brought down to 200mw. The book speculates that this person insisted on the lower thermal output because he assumed it would be safer, and to my (layman's) mind, this seems to make sense. 

As it happened, due to operator error, the thermal output of the reactor dropped to around 30mw, leading to xenon poisoning in the reactor. To bring the reactor back up to 200mw, virtually all of the control rods in the reactor were manually removed and numerous automatic failsafes were overridden. Supposing instead that the reactor was gradually brought down from its normal operating level to 200mw, could something still have gone wrong owing only to the low thermal output?",606,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/do0n1s/how_would_the_low_thermal_output_of_chernobyls/

I've heard stories about people watching and analyzing slot machines and trying to snipe jackpots from them, and I'm curious to what extent these stories are true, and if manufacturers WANT the machines to be exploitable. The most obvious answer would be no, they don't want anyone rigging the game. But of course, if a slot machine CAN be gained but it happens to be hard to do so, more people will try (and fail) to gain the system, thus increasing revenue for the manufacturer. For something like this, you might want something that's NOT cryptographically secure, like MD5 or even Mersenne Twister.

For example, if I have light between 508 and 508.1 THz, I have frequencies that include 508.01, 508.011, 508.0111, etc. and that is only a small subset of the actual range of frequencies.

Every single frequency should have a photon with energy equal to Plank's constant times its frequency.  So, the minimum energy of a photon in the example range is 3.3660436362×10^−19 J.  That times infinity is, of course, infinity.

Am I wrong in thinking that the momentum of the earths rotation has nothing to do with the way the “skin” of the earth; the mantle moves over time? For instance the lower hemisphere seems to have much greater distances between the continents that the North hemisphere as well as greater vertical separation from the land masses. I also notice when moving the masses together the way they fit that there are areas missing, I would assume (dangerous word I know) that these missing parts could easily be meteor strikes  as it would to me make the most sense. How did such strikes affect movement, could they force an either complete change in the direction of the earth’s spin perhaps several times over huge periods of time? Or could the force of such impacts just push the land masses apart at greater speed, as a high speed impact would do to anything else? Again I speak only from visual studies.

248,Immunological memory exists so that our immune system can mount a proper immune response to a previously encountered antigen. Do we have a memory system for non-antigens?,"For example, let's say it's spring time and there is much pollen in the air. Does the immune system bind to the pollen molecules and determine it is a non-antigen every single time it encounters it, or does it mark the pollen as a non-antigen for the future?

The reason I ask this is that common allergies are caused by our immune system improperly acting upon a non-antigen (they treat something like pollen as something dangerous, when it really isn't). Let's say there's a 1% chance that our body develops an allergic reaction to pollen; that means after 100 exposures it is likely that a person develops some sort of response, unless the body has determined it to be a non-antigen and can recognize it so!

268,Why does growing meat add more carbon to the air than plants do?,"Now I understand that at the surface this seems kind of dumb. Cow has to eat plants and is breathing, which adds carbon it's entire life, then gets given to us, instead of plants that absorb carbon that are fed to us. Simple.

But then I was thinking. Wouldn't this process be carbon neutral regardless of whether we eat plants or meat?


In the case of plant, it's a shorter path. Plant absorbs carbon and stores it in mostly carbohydrates. So it's basically taken water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide and used that to store energy in the form of some compounds with carbon, hydrogen, and maybe oxygen (not too sure on the chemistry here, but definitely carbon and hydrogen are there.) Gives off some oxygen in the process. 


Now we eat these molecules, take oxygen, basically combust the molecules and get water, carbon dioxide, and energy as a result. So, carbon from air goes into plant, comes out of our lungs. No carbon was pulled from Earth, no new carbon added to atmosphere. Carbon neutral process. 


Now with meat, the cow does the same thing we did. Of course it stores some of that carbon in fat and proteins, but again, all of the carbon it is comprised of came from the air. Nobody is digging up oil and feeding it to the cow. Then we eat the cow, releasing some of the carbon it didn't. This process is just less efficient, sure, but in my mind still carbon neutral. 


Now there is the methane farts of these cows. But methane is again some carbon and hydrogen. So some bacteria are getting fed too. 


Yet we still hear that meat is much worse for climate change than plants. I don't think this is a false statement yet, but is this simply a logistics issue? As in, the land required to grow the plants came from a forest, the transportation needed, and so on? I want to understand where the new carbon (by this I mean carbon that wasn't in the atmosphere in the last few centuries) is coming into play.

2) Why does CP work longer than HP?

3) Can someone provide some solid reasoning to support or deny the claim that LEDs are effective in teeth whitening? Is the LED supposed to activate the CP faster or simply dry out your teeth so that CP can work faster without interference from your saliva?

4) How much CP at 44% needs to be applied, how often, and for how long for beat results?

5) I have read that CP/HP essentially removes a very thin layer of enamel each time you apply it and leave it on. Does this essentially mean that if you continue to apply it, eventually it will remove enough enamel to become harmful/dangerous? Does CP whiten your teeth by actually penetrating your teeth and bleaching the inside, or by removing a thin layer (this essentially only removing surface stains), or both?

286,Why do statistics behave differently when identical particles are involved?,"I'm borrowing the example from [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles#Statistical_properties_of_bosons_and_fermions).  Let's say I have two indistinguishable bosons, each of which can exist in two states, |0> and |1>.  If I put the two particles together in a noisy environment, let them evolve for some time, and then measure their states, I have a 33% probability each of measuring |00>, |01>, or |11>.  This makes sense on some level --- the combined system had three possible states, all of the same energy, and a uniform distribution over those states maximizes entropy.

Obviously, this doesn't generalize to normal macroscopic systems.  If I put two coins in a cup, shake them for a while, and observe their state, I would expect to find two heads with 25% probability, two tails with 25% probability, and 1 heads and one tails with 50% probability.  Of course, macroscopic coins are not indistinguishable, but where exactly does indistinguishably change the statistics so fundamentally?  Is it at the time of observation?  If I observed the state with a sufficiently low-resolution camera, that could resolve heads and tails, but not distinguish the two coins by any markings, would my observations mimic the quantum-mechanical case?  Or is the indistinguishably important while the coins/particles are time-evolving in a noisy environment?

Of course, I know that quantum mechanics are inherently counter-intuitive, and I shouldn't expect my normal intuitions to apply.  However, the classical behavior should be a limiting case of the quantum-mechanical behavior, and I don't see where the boundaries between the classical and quantum-mechanical behavior lies.

288,How does maintaing methane levels influence global heating?,"I best explain. First of all I am a scientist myself, though is slightly outside my comfort zone. I'm hoping a greenhouse gas specialist could answer.

Methane breaksdown over 8-10 years. So lets say that every year we produce exactly the same amount of methane, we get to a state where the methane is being put into the atmosphere at the same rate by which it is breaking down (let's forget about CO2 and other GHGs for now).

If atmoshpheric methane remains constant, will it maintain the current temperatue (pre-industrial +1.5c)? or will it continually have a warming effect, pushing up global temperatures. 

To word it a different away:

Is the impact of methane in the atmosphere mainly from the simple abundance of it. Or is it the abundance of it multiplied by it's time present.

I appreciate it is a bit more nuanced that I am making it, but I hope my question comes across. Please ask if I am not being clear enough.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dlggth/how_does_maintaing_methane_levels_influence/

As for Foucault's Pendulum, why is the plane that the pendulum rotates in separate from the rotation of the earth?

The pendulum is attached to the string, which is attached to the building, which is attached to the earth, so shouldn't the movement of the room also move the string, which would move the pendulum? Why would the swinging of the pendulum change in relation to the ground?

- Are the differences merely in structure and formation, or do they exhibit different behaviors?
- Would it be safe to drink ice water (the beverage) that contains ice *other* than [Ice I^h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ih)?
- Do these other phases appear in Nature, or do we have to create them in a lab?
- I can see all kinds of neat characteristics of each on Wikipedia, but these characteristics are the kind you would read about in a lab report based on the special analysis tools they have.

And a herbivore is an animal that eats plants while a carnivore is an animal that eats other animals.

In my mind, biologically speaking, carnivores and herbivores are very similar, while plants are very much different.

Well, in the microscopic world, would a small single cell organism, such as an amoeba- eating plant material (single celled organism that use photosynthesis for food such as algae) be considered a herbivore or carnivore?

I'm asking because I'm my mind comparing a lion to a horse is not the same as comparing a horse to hay. 

While comparing an amoeba to a diatom doesn't seem to make as much of a difference as a horse to hay.

367,How does earth compare to what we know about exoplanets in the circumsteller habitable zone?,"Been watching a bunch of Star Trek, and I started to wonder:  If we take the traditional idea of oxygen-breathing aliens evolving on a planet with a day-night cycle and a temperature where liquid water is common on the surface, how does earth compare?  Are earthlings from a heavy gravity planet?  Or a light gravity planet?  What about the color and intensity of sunlight?  


From what I've found while searching, red dwarfs would be unlikely to have an habitable zone planet that wasn't tidally locked, so that's out of the bounds of the question.  K dwarfs look promising though, and are more common than G type stars, as well as a longer interstellar lifespan.  If that is true, then the average hypothetical alien would be used to a more orangish ""sunlight"".  Not sure how that would translate to the intensity of sunlight on the surface, of how the atmosphere would change the color of the starlight.  


Planetary mass is a harder question for me, as a layman to answer.  Obviously our systems are biased towards finding heavier planets, but there's likely some statistical analysis that I'm not aware of, showing the likelyhood of smaller planets.  Too small, and obviously the planet cannot hold onto an atmosphere.  Not sure where the bound is though, nor the upper bound where the planet becomes too large to avoid being a gas giant.  (Plate tectonics would be another factor, but the science seems unsettled if superearths would have active plate tectonics).

Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading.

Not only that but we want to be able to not make the hardware overly complex and support every feature in our high level language.”

How can the high level language provide functionality that doesn’t exist in the hardware in *some* fashion? I’ve heard this before, that we want to separate software implementation and hardware implementation (or something to that effect), which I can’t understand - somewhere someway there must be hardware doing what this language supports via the assembler/compiler/translator.

The only thing I can think of is she’s being imprecise and what she means is that the hardware can support all these high level language features, just not intrinsically - There is no machine instruction an assembler can invoke to make something eg “volatile” as in the c++ library, but it can build something equivalent from simple instructions that make up a RISC processor?

I asked my teacher why this was, but she didn't have an answer. 

Why is this the case? Does it have something to do with hydrogen bonding? I get that water is a special case because it has some weird properties, but why specifically?

Any help in answering this question is greatly appreciated!",1634,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dig96b/why_is_the_heat_capacity_of_liquid_water_so_much/
412,Is it known how animals have hardcoded skills at birth?,"Has this one been worked out yet?

As in baby turtles are born, and they just...know what to do. Get across that sand, get into those waves, try not to get eaten and then swim around and go to all the right places and eat the right things instead of munching on coral for a snack.

The adult turtles don't appear to be teaching them, and many animals likewise appear to have hardcoded (and sometimes quite complex) skills and patterns of behaviour.

Is it known how this mechanism works at this point?

413,How is genetic information arranged across chromosomes?,"We all learn in school that (nearly) all animal cells contain DNA. We also learn that humans have 46 chromosomes, arranged in pairs. But that's where the details seem to end unless we go study this stuff on our own. Therefore, my questions:

1. Do we have *exactly* 46 DNA molecules in each non-sex-cell cell (two copies of each)? Or do we have many repeating copies of the same 23 DNA molecules? Are the two DNA strands in a chromosome identical? Or is a chromosome just one huge molecule with two arms?
2. [Different chromosomes have different genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome#Human_chromosomes). So is there such a thing as a ""complete"" strand of DNA? Is our genetic information spread across them all?
3. Since Mitochondrial DNA is *only* inherited from the mother, has the Mitochondrial DNA been sequenced? Does it do anything other than converting food into ATP? Do we include Mitochondrial DNA in what we call the human genome?
4. When gene expression occurs, I know the cells use the DNA to synthesize proteins and other stuff. How do the cells know *which* DNA strand to use, and where to find the thing it needs?
5. Is DNA *always* arranged into chromosomes?

Basically I'm trying to understand why we have two kinds of DNA and how our genetic instructions are arranged. I've been studying neurology and neuroscience (you know, for fun); and it's making me start thinking about also studying gene expression.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dj2i6b/how_is_genetic_information_arranged_across/

Firstly, Standing Waves:
  
He began by saying that standing waves occur when the line is not terminated correctly, then went on to say that standing waves are what create the electromagnetic wave that propagates out with the signal.
  
Question: how are the waves produced and what is their relationship with the standing wave?
  
Secondly, Propagation:
  
Every time he brings up the propagation, he says that a wave cycle in the signal creates a new wave front which pushes out the previous wave front, and then it travels at the speed of light.
  
Question: If EMF is self-propagating, which is how I understand that these waves work, why is he saying that the wave fronts are being pushed away by the following wave front that is produced by the signal from the transmitter?
  
These questions may be quite specific, but his explanations of the operation of transmitting antennas has only confused me about what I thought I knew, and I need some clarification.

I just published a paper in Nature Biotechnology entitled ""[Genomic and phenotypic analyses of six offspring of a genome-edited hornless bull](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0266-0)"". For the past two years, my laboratory and collaborators have been studying six offspring of a dairy bull, genome-edited to prevent it from growing horns. This technology has been proposed as an alternative to dehorning, a common management practice performed to protect other cattle and human handlers from injuries. We found that none of the bull's offspring developed horns, as expected, and blood work and physical exams of the calves found they were all healthy. We also sequenced the genomes of the calves and their parents and analyzed these genomic sequences. Our study found that two calves inherited the naturally-occurring hornless allele, and four calves additionally inherited a fragment of bacterial DNA, known as a plasmid. This study has generated some media interest, and I am here to answer questions about the study, and genome editing more generally.

On a personal note I'm originally from Australia where I completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at The University of Melbourne, before completing my Masters and Ph.D. in Genetics at UC Davis. I have now lived in California for over 30 years with my husband who is a reproductive biologist studying white sturgeon.

548,"How Do Propagation of Action Potentials, and Automaticity Work?","Just wanting to check my understanding to see if I'm in the ballpark of the correct answers.

So, how does propagation of action potentials work? Is it when the initial cell depolarizes, the K+ in the ECF causes an increase in membrane potential of the adjacent cell, which causes Na+ to go into the ICF of that cell? If so, why wouldn't the time-sensitive Na+ inactivation gates close, similar to hyperkalemia? I guess I'm just not sure how prolonged depolarization has to be in order to shut the gates. I'm pretty sure it's only a fraction of a second, so why wouldn't they close in this case?

Also, how does automaticity work? Since there are no EPSPs or IPSPs giving the initial stimulation, what is? I read that there are less inward rectifier K+ channels, so the potential never returns to the negative charge needed for fast Na+ channels to become active, so would this mean that it's simply the leakage of Na+ through the slow channels that bump it up to the \~ -55mV needed to open up the calcium channels? If so, why is this called ""spontaneous,"" especially if there's a steady beat, all else equal?

1) What happens after a molecule of CO2 absorbs some thermal radiation.  Does it immediately re-emit that thermal radiation?  If so, does it re-emit it at the same wavelength or one slightly different?

2) What direction does it re-emit it in?  Is it a random direction or does it always bounce back the way it came?

In honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, ask us anything!","During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month each October, current and former patients, advocates, and scientists work together to educate the public about a disease that touches the lives of millions of Americans every year. In 2019 alone, researchers expect more than 300,000 American women to be diagnosed with breast cancer, along with more than 2,600 men. Roughly one out of every eight American women will develop invasive breast cancer at some point in her lifetime, making it the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in American women.

In recognition of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) have partnered to bring you an ""Ask Me Anything"" with two prominent researchers in the NCI's Women's Malignancies Branch: Stanley Lipkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., and Alexandra Zimmer, M.D. Dr. Lipkowitz studies cellular and molecular pathways that regulate the growth and destruction of breast and ovarian cancer cells, while Dr. Zimmer, the Branch's Clinical Director, develops translational clinical trials to study treatments for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, particularly the brain. She also investigates ways of preventing breast cancer from leaving the breast in the first place, a
process known as metastasis.

Dr. Zimmer and Dr. Lipkowitz will be online from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm ET (17-19 UT) to answer your questions. Ask them anything!

like i'd always thought of a black hole as something that's literally eating matter, but really that's just a product of it's massive nature.

i guess my point is, if by their nature we can't see them how can we actually say they're a singularity and not something else that just happens to be incredibly dense and massive?

for instance as a specific example, supermassive black holes appear to be fairly different to other black holes, even if it's just due to their mass.

We're here to answer your questions. AUA!","Hi Reddit, tomorrow is National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day, and we hope you'll have a gas! Hydrogen and fuel cells are the perfect partners for clean, fuel-efficient transportation and a secure energy future. Here at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), we have expertise in creating low carbon hydrogen from natural gas, and we have two projects we want to discuss with you. The first is Solar Thermochemical Advanced Reactor System-or STARS, a technology that converts a record-setting 70 percent of solar energy into chemical energy, such as hydrogen. STARS uses thermal energy from the sun to break down natural gas and water into hydrogen and carbon dioxide in a steam methane reforming process. PNNL licensed STARS to a spin-off company, STARS, LLC, who is working with Southern California Gas Company to implement the technology. Read about STARS here: https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/05/20181518-stars.html.

The second project uses a low-emission process to convert natural gas to hydrogen, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotubes. The process creates hydrogen that can be used in fuel cell vehicles and industrial processes, as well as carbon fiber that can be used in applications from medical devices and aerospace structures to building products. The goal of the project is to make hydrogen-fueled cars and trucks cost-competitive with conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. In addition, this technology would virtually eliminate CO2 emissions from the methane-to-hydrogen process. The technology development and commercialization team includes PNNL; West Virginia University; Southern California Gas Company; and C4-MCP, a Santa Monica-based start-up company. Read more about project here: https://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/01/20180105-socalgas.html.

645,Planets clear their orbits of debris (or they're not called planets). So why don't SMBHs clear their galaxies of dark matter?,"THANKS everyone, I have the answer. I was suffering from a lack of perspective, so it's off to the Total Perspective Vortex for me.

---
Whatever DM is, it interacts with gravity so there should at all times be a steady stream of DM falling past the SMBH's event horizon and on to the singularity, never to emerge except via Hawking radiation in the far future.

Many galaxies are disc-shaped but their DM tends to exist in a (more) spherical globule surrounding the galactic center (GC), according to artist's impressions of DM distribution, which are of course based on whatever the physics is that's being illustrated. I have to assume those images are accurate depictions.

So if those images are showing globules of DM surrounding GCs, why are those globs of DM still there? Why doesn't the SMBH ""vacuum"" it all up within a few million years, or whatever relatively short time scale?

**Tell me if this is wrong:** DM exists in elliptical orbits around GCs. But those orbital paths would be distorted by other stars near the SMBH, causing some of the DM to be accelerated into the SMBC on a steady basis until there was none left outside the EH.

But it *seems* that doesn't happen. What's really going on? It seems that the still unknown exact nature of DM wouldn't affect the problem as I've stated it.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/deo3ns/planets_clear_their_orbits_of_debris_or_theyre/
646,At what distance does heat effect magnetism?,"So to demagnetize a magnet, you have to heat it up to 176*F for an extended period (or hotter for shorter time period), and/or beat it with a hammer.

With that in mind (that heat demagnetizes), at what distance does heat effect the magnetic waves, and at what distance?

For example, if I held a lighter near a magnet, would that demagnetize the magnetic waves coming from that area of the magnet? How close would it need to be? Obviously magnetic waves dissipate the farther they get from the source, so if you held the magnet at the weakest waves farthest from the magnet, would it demagnetize there?

How much heat and how much distance, to actually demagnetize the magnetic waves (not the magnet itself)?

>A team of Ontario researchers says their latest study could help pave the way for different approaches to treating depression.

>The study – completed at McMaster University’s Brain-Body Institute and published this week in Scientific Reports – concluded a common class of antidepressants works by stimulating activity in the gut and key nerves connected to it rather than the brain as previously believed.

>The research focused on Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant that’s known to benefit patients but whose functioning is little understood by the medical community.

>The McMaster researchers spent nearly a year testing SSRIs on mice in a bid to solve the puzzle.

>They found that mice taking the medication showed much greater stimulation of neurons in the gut wall, as well as the vagus nerve that connects the gut to the brain. Those benefits disappeared if the vagus nerve was surgically cut.

>Study co-author Karen-Anne McVey Neufeld says the findings suggest the gut may play a larger role in depression than previously believed and the latest research hints at new treatment possibilities in the future.

I couldn't find an accurate source for the average amount of macros a man/woman eats, but I found this quote that seemed pretty close to what I imagine it is, and what I learned from in health class (If someone knows a source please link it.

["" Adults should get 45 percent to 65 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, 20 percent to 35 percent from fat, and 10 to 35 percent from protein ""](http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2002/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Energy-Carbohydrate-Fiber-Fat-Fatty-Acids-Cholesterol-Protein-and-Amino-Acids.aspx)  


I can't help but think that compared to thousands of years ago, there's so much mass-produces carbohydrates found everywhere like rice, bread, pastries, desserts, pasta, etc. Back when humans were primitive and there wasn't much as much mass-production of food, what would you think their average macros would be?

739,Does density of a substance change discontinuously at its melting point?,"Does the density as a function of temperature for a pure substance change discontinuously at its melting point? Or does it merely change very fast but nonetheless continuously. 

&#x200B;

For example, wikipedia says that mercury changes from a solid density of 13.69 g/cm\^3 to a liquid density of 14.184 g/cm\^3 at its melting point of -38.83 degrees C ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury\_(element)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element))). But if I had a super precise heat control that could let me control the temperature down to hundredths of a mK if necessary (and plenty of time to let the sample fully equilibrate), could I get a mercury sample of, say, 13.9 g/cm\^3?

&#x200B;

I had always thought of density as changing discontinuously during melting, but I realize now that at least some other phase change properties are not totally discontinuous even when we may think of them that way. Electrical resistance, for instance, is not totally discontinuous when undergoing a superconductivity phase change, but instead transitions rapidly over a few mK. This is even the basis of very sensitive thermometers called ""Transition Edge Sensors (TES)"" ([http://web.mit.edu/figueroagroup/ucal/ucal\_tes/](http://web.mit.edu/figueroagroup/ucal/ucal_tes/)).  See especially the figure [http://web.mit.edu/figueroagroup/ucal/ucal\_tes/files/page14\_1.png](http://web.mit.edu/figueroagroup/ucal/ucal_tes/files/page14_1.png)

&#x200B;

So does density during melting behave like electrical resistance during super conductivity transition (IE changing fast but nonetheless continuously with temperature)? Or is it truly discontinuous, with no possibility of achieving a density between the two transition values, regardless of how finely one can control the temperature?",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/dcip7d/does_density_of_a_substance_change/

We graphed the amount of current that is flowing through the semiconductor over the temperature the it’s exposed to.

With linearly increasing heat, the current increased in a curve.

This doesn’t make sense to me because we learned in class, that because of the increasing heat, more electrons can free themselves from their bonds and start flowing, which allows more current to pass through. With this explanation, I would think that if there is double the amount of heat, the reaction of the semiconductor would be to let double as many electrons flow freely. This would result in a linearly growing line in the above mentioned graph.

This is not the case, and that’s what I’m confused about.

789,How does the value of a field propagate? (physics),"In the entry level physics courses when you have a charged particle you are told to put a 'test charge' somewhere in your problem (the field) and evaluate what the forces should be if you actually had a test charge in that position. My understanding is that if you did have a test charge in that location that there would be an exchange of force carriers (photons in this particular field) between the source and the test charges. This would be how they interact and determine the effect they have on one another.

What I'm curious about is how the field exists without a test charge. The way I have always thought about it is that there is a 'sea' of virtual particles propagating out from the source charge throughout the entire region of that field (which I guess is infinite?) and those virtual particles interacting with one another carry the 'field value' for any particular point. But the idea of infinite virtual particles propagating for everything that projects a field feels intuitively wrong....

So that is my question: How does a point in a field, electromagnetic or otherwise, 'know' what value to evaluate to be. Sea of virtual particles, or is the field an object in itself and does the field just update itself in an outwardly moving wave from each source particle that exists inside of it?

Second reason: When things get hot, atoms and molecules bump into each other. This excites the electrons into more energetic orbits and when they decay back into lower orbits, the excess energy is given off as discrete packets of electromagnetic radiation known as photons.

I'm here to dispel some rumours about my fascinating subject area and demonstrate how maths is becoming an increasingly important tool in our fight to understand biological processes in the real world.

I've also just published a new popular maths book called the Math(s) of Life and Death which is [out in the UK](https://amzn.to/2MkmdcM) and available to [pre-order in the US](https://www.amazon.com/Math-Life-Death-Mathematical-Principles/dp/1982111879/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?crid=VWXFWH6IJA6W&keywords=the+maths+of+life+and+death+kit+yates&qid=1564181090&s=gateway&sprefix=the+math+of+life+and+death+%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-1-fkmr0). In the book I explore the true stories of life-changing events in which the application (or misapplication) of mathematics has played a critical role: patients crippled by faulty genes and entrepreneurs bankrupt by faulty algorithms; innocent victims of miscarriages of justice and the unwitting victims of software glitches. I follow stories of investors who have lost fortunes and parents who have lost children, all because of mathematical misunderstanding. I wrestle with ethical dilemmas from screening to statistical subterfuge and examine pertinent societal issues such as political referenda, disease prevention, criminal justice and artificial intelligence. I show that mathematics has something profound or significant to say on all of these subjects, and more.

On a personal note I'm from Manchester, UK, so it's almost a pre-requisite that I love football (Manchester City) and Music (Oasis were my favourite band).

813,Are electromagnetic waves getting weaker with distance in vacuum?,"So does electromagnetic waves fade when they are travelling through vacuum?  
Let's say we have point S (source point), A (10 units from source) and B (100 units from source).   
At point S there is an AM transmitter that turns on and transmits on a certain frequency. At both point A and B there are AM receivers tuned to that frequency. Will the strength of this source signal be the same, regarding that distances between source are different for those two receivers?   


What I mean - this EM wave generated by the transmitter is going in all directions from the source, forming a sphere and spreading through vacuum (at least that's the way I understand it). I also understand that those waves carry energy in some way (correct me if I'm wrong). As we get furtherer from the source there are more points where we can receive this wave (thus the energy it's carrying). So according to the law of conservation of energy this signal should be weaker on a greater distance because it spread on a bigger area.

Shortly after infection, patients experience flu-like symptoms for a few weeks.  They feel better after that time because their body has produced a sufficient number of antibodies to prevent the virus from killing them.  Untreated patients then feel fine for a long period of time (years or even decades) before developing opportunistic infections resulting from AIDS.  These infections usually kill the patient within a few years.

My question is this: given that the human body seems to be capable of preventing the virus from destroying its host's immune system for several years, how does the virus make any progress?  Why do the HIV-specific antibodies slow down the progression of the disease, but not stop it?

820,How does cocaine get into the hair structure through use and environmental exposure?,"I'm reading an article that was published in Analytical Chemistry that discusses the current methodology for forensic hair drug analysis in Europe. 

The Society of Hair Testing says that hair samples should be prepped with an organic solvent wash followed by aqueous washes to remove contaminants. 

However, a 3-year-old paper discovered that if the hair is somehow contaminated with cocaine (I guess either through lab error or maybe the person goes to places where cocaine particulates/vapor is in the air) the cocaine will permeate throughout the hair and present like user hair. 

The authors looked at the cross-section of hair with a MetA-SIMS (TRIFT II TOF-SIMS) and compared it with conventional methods (LC-MS/MS). The contamination wasn't removed in the washes with organic solvents and water according to the LC-MS/MS, it permeated throughout the hair according to the TOF-SIMS. 

I'm trying to figure out 2 things. One: How does cocaine chemically enter the hair if you're a user? Two: If cocaine hydrochloride (cocaine a rich person might buy) is water soluble, why isn't it coming out in the water? Why is permeating the hair further? (However this is also true for cocaine base, or ""crack"" cocaine. Though I'm having issues determining solubility with crack cocaine.) 

FWIW, hair is composed of mostly keratin. Keratin is helical due to hydrogen bondings and has sulfate groups due to cysteine. Hair also has minerals due to diet and water, and contains lipids (cocaine vapor is lipophilic).

828,Can pregnancy hormones make straight hair curly or curly hair straight - all the way to long ends and not just the new growth?,"I have been told and have also read many times that this is a possibility. But here is my problem with a blanket statement like that coming from a parenting article or my hair dresser: I understand that lots of things can change the shape of the hair follicle, which in turn changes the texture and curl pattern of the hair shaft. However, if a person already has longer hair ( mine, for example, is a few inches past my shoulders) I cannot understand how the shift in hormones under a less than one year time span, can affect the shape and texture of the hair shaft all the way to the bottom. New growth, yes. I can understand that. But now at 7 months pregnant, my hair is very wavy (about a 2B on the curl pattern chart) and is a shock to me and others who know me. But my thought is that it must have been leaning towards wanting to be wavy for years and I've only just decided to start encouraging the process and therefore, it has now seemingly sprung in to curls. Or, since the beginning of this pregnancy, the hormones have caused a shift in the shape of my hair follicle, therefore increasing the curl tendency in my new growth, which is helping to support the wave tendency in the rest of my long hair.

Is it possible for hormones to change curl structure all the way to the ends of hair which could have been growing for multiple years, and couldn't be affected by a hormonal change at the scalp in a short time period?

This is the most scientific article I could find on the topic, and it doesn't address the idea of long hair, just need growth from the follicle.

833,Is c÷(average wavelength) the same as the (average frequency) of a spectrum?,"So, I'm having a little trouble here. I want to know the average energy of the photons emitted by a LED. What I have is the graph of intensity by wavelength. 

&#x200B;

I know that each point in the graph is actually the intensity integrated over a small interval near that point (analogous to a displacement vs time graph where each point is the displacement during a small time interval around that time). 

&#x200B;

But say that instead of that I had an actual continuous power distribution function, a graph now analogous to a velocity vs time graph. I must integrate the function over an interval of λ to find the intensity on that interval.  


I'll call that function i(λ)  (lowercase 'i' because that's not an intensity now but rather a ""density"")  


I want to convert it to a function i(f) in such a way that the integrated intensity over an equivalent interval is the same, in other words  


i(f)df = i(λ)dλ   


Once f = c/λ  ->  df = (-c/λ²)dλ  ->  i(f)\*(-c/λ²)dλ  = i(λ)dλ -> i(f)  = -(λ²/c)i(λ)

&#x200B;

So I might choose i(λ) = kλ for example. 'k' is a constant that will deal with the units. And I might choose an λ interval from a to b meters. The integral of i(λ) will be (k/2)(b²-a²)

The frequency-domain function will be i(f) = -kλ³/c = -kc²/f³ 

The primitive integral of of that function is (kc²/2)/f² + C. Integrating from c/a to c/b (the equivalent interval in the frequency domain) the the result is (kc²/2)\*\[1/(c/b)²-1/(c/a)²\]= (kc²/2)\*\[b²-a²\]/c²   
= (k/2)(b²-a²)  


This is the same result and shows that the the power distributions check - They give the same total intensity for the same interval. Being that, obviously, each function have different units once they have different domains, but the units of the integrated intensity will be the same.

&#x200B;

Now for the average value of wavelength and frequency:  


i(λ)\*λ = kλ² -> integral over the interval a to b = (k/3)(b³-a³)

dividing by the integral intensity we have (k/3)(b²-a²)/\[(k/2)(b³-a³)\] -> λ(av) = (2/3)(b³-a³)/(b²-a²) 

&#x200B;

i(f)\*f =  -kc²/f²  -> integral over the interval of c/a to c/b =  kc(b-a)  

dividing by the integral intensity we have kc(b-a) /\[(k/2)(b³-a³)\] -> f(av) = 2c(b-a)(b²-a²)  

  
If I took λ(av)  and found the equivalent frequency, I'd have  c/λ(av) = c(3/2)(b²-a²)/(b³-a³), which is not the same as 2c(b-a)(b²-a²)  

For example, choosing a=100 m and b=300 m ->   
λ(av) = (650/3) m,   
c/λ(av) = 1383657.50 Hz, and    
f(av)  = 1498962.29 Hz.   


They are reasonably close to each other but not equal

So far in class we've mostly just been going over the expansion of the universe, so I tried to justify the assertion in this video to myself: we cannot travel outside of our local group. 

The Hubble constant at the current time is 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. I set up an equation where the change in distance, dx, is equal to the hubble constant times the distance times the change in time, dt. Solving the differential equation, you get that the final distance is equal to about 1.03 times the initial distance over the course of 500 million years. Something about 3 mpc away (the diameter of the local group) would not even increase in distance by a megaparsec. At half the speed of light, you could travel about 77 mpc in this time. This is ~25 times the diameter of the local group.

I know that the Hubble parameter changes in time, but my textbook seemed to suggest that it would not change in any meaningful way over the course of 500 myr. Even if it increased by two orders of magnitude (I tried this by just having it start at two orders of magnitude higher), the distance is still well within travel distance.

However, recently I came across the [equation](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/nozzled.html): (M2-1)dV/V=dA/A. I think this equation should hold for both incompressible and compressible flow. It implies that there must be a throat to compress the flow to Mach 1. Then, the throat must diverge to provide supersonic flow.   
Where this doesn't make sense to me is that area\*velocity=constant must also hold. So, if the throat diverges, the velocity must decrease since density stays constant.   
The only possible explanation I could come up with is that the density actually does change because empty space is created while velocity and area increase?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d9o0f6/can_you_make_supersonic_incompressible_flow/

876,Why do we need spinors?,"I understand that there is some important connection between spin and the groups SU(2) and SO(3). It's often pointed out that SU(2) double covers SO(3), and that the Pauli matrices form a basis for the Lie algebra su(2) (up to a factor of i). But I'm having trouble understanding the connection.

As I understand, SU(2) is the symmetry group of spinors (as diagrams like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Spinor_on_the_circle.png) point out - you need a double-covering of SO(3) in order to cover all spinor-space symmetries). This is why this group is so important in the theory of spin. A question that just occurred to me is why the Pauli matrices happen to form a representation of the Lie algebra su(2); does the algebra of observables of a system always have to be some representation of the system's symmetry group Lie algebra? But we can put that question to one side.

I'm especially confused because the theory of spin in quantum mechanics is usually presented as (a generalised version of) the theory of orbital angular momentum. The commutation relations between spin observables are derived in terms of the canonical commutation relations of linear position and momentum.

So then, could someone connect this intro QM exposition of spin to the groups SU(2) and SO(3)?

I'm also vaguely aware of Clifford algebra representations of spin. As far as I can tell spin states are represented by rotors which happen to double-cover SO(3). But that just kicks the can down the road: why should rotors represent angular momentum?

920,Is there a way to measure a gene's dominance?,"So I was thinking about the very basics of genetics I learned at school and stumbled upon this thought, despite not caring much for biology class not understanding this concept still bothers me due to my disliking of randomness.

Can a gene's dominance somehow be determined without specific testing?

My guess would be this, if gene A is dominant over gene B and gene B is dominant over gene C can I assume gene A is also dominant over gene C? so gene A could be assigned a dominance level of 3, B assigned 2 and C assigned 1. Can someone please disprove this for me?

Alternatively maybe genes could be assigned classes, with class A being dominant over class B, class B dominant over class C, class C dominant over class A and D, and class D dominant over class B, so you can assume that if a gene is dominant over class A it must belong to class C hence also dominant over class D. Although this one might be practically impossible to prove due to a potentially infinite amount of classes, so if a gene is dominant over class A it might still not be dominant over class D and instead belong to a new class E.

Is there a more likely theory? perhaps based on experimentation rather then thoughts some kid had while walking his dog? or is this subject rather unexplored and I can't hope for an answer any time soon?

939,Am I understanding this water contamination measurement confusion correctly?,"Our water system in the city I live was recently contaminated with PFAS and PFOS at levels around 1500 ppt (the EPA guidelines currently list 70 ppt as the maximum safe limit).

&#x200B;

I'm trying to wrap my head around how much of this stuff I've actually consumed.

I came across this website explaining how to calculate it

[https://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20170818/what-does-140-parts-per-trillion-look-like](https://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20170818/what-does-140-parts-per-trillion-look-like)

Its my understanding that the the 1500 ppt is the total amount found in the water supply, and once you calculate how much water you injested during that contamination window you can get a rough idea of how many ppt you actually injested.

So even if you had a glass of water, that isn't the full 1500 ppt in your system, but a mere fraction of the total 1500 ppt. eg: 1x 8 oz glass out of a olympic sized swimming pool as they describe it in that article.

Assuming my thought process is correct.  Then I've actually only consumed like 0.001% of a ppt of the stuff.

Is the 70ppt a lifetime limit? eg: I could drive enough water till that 0.001% adds up to a full 70 ppt?  Or is the fact that it started over the 70 ppt limit (1500pt) already an issue?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d8vmj2/am_i_understanding_this_water_contamination/

This mentions that heat shock proteins (HSPs) “aid in refolding of damaged or denatured proteins,” but it does not discuss the mechanism by which this is accomplished other than stating that it increases the fidelity of protein synthesis. Wikipedia seems to just state that it stabilizes partially unfolded proteins, and chaperones other proteins, as I read it across organelle membranes. I am curious of the mechanism, is it attaching to other proteins like a ribosome or enzyme? 

Also, can HSPs be used to help treat prion diseases as they are a result of misfolded proteins? I see an article in 2014 discussing this potential, and also one this year showing mice lacking genes encoding for HSP synthesis have accelerated prion disease progression. I don’t see anything further suggesting advances in trying to use HSPs for prevention or treatment of prion diseases, and maybe I’m just missing a piece of the puzzle.

I’m just curious about HSPs and their potential. I’m in a pathophysiology course and this article is suggested reading but I don’t have to do any homework related to it so I’m not asking for homework help, just trying to answer some questions that came up when reading.

948,Why can't a fighter jet reach orbit?,"Hey guys,

I just had a discussion with a friend which began with the reasons for the failure of the Space Shuttle.

In the process we asked ourselves why you can't just fly straight upwards with a fighter jet to reach orbit which would cost much less than a rocket launch.

We thought that maybe it is because the jets kinetic force is too low to reach the first cosmic speed so we compared it to a falcon 9:

* The Eurofighter has a max. force of roughly 180kN and weighs 11T which is 16,4N/kg
* The Falcon 9 has 9 x \~1000kN and weighs about 550T which is also 16,4N/kg

So they both have around the same force per kg - shouldn't a Eurofighter then be able to just fly to space (maybe with some extra tanks)?

Maybe there is a obvious reason why this can't work so thank you for your answers :)

I’m painting some miniatures of underwater creatures like turtles and sharks and what have you for a game I play, and I want to paint them as if they live (the majority of their time) in a lightless environment, drawing on real world deep sea creatures and pigmentation for comparison!  My biggest concerns are things like pattern and general color.  

I know that, over time, many sea creatures like sharks and some fish have evolved white under bellies and dark backs, because if predators looked from above they would see the back blend in with the surroundings, and if they looked from below they would see the underbelly blend in with the sunlight.  Is that type of biology functional or even present in a deep sea habitat?  What about patterns meant to evoke warning or confusion, like the vibrant colors of a lion fish or the stripes on a tiger shark?

Concerning color, I’m interested to get an idea of the types of colors (or lack thereof) generally exhibited by animals in the deep sea.  Even though there’s no/little light, there skin still probably reflects some color when light is introduced, yeah?

977,Why is LIQUID hydrogen so light/low-density?,"Liquid or Cryogenic Hydrogen for rockets has a very good energy density ***per gram*** compared to other common fuels like liquid methane or liquid kerosene. But the density of liquid hydrogen is really really low so the energy density **per litre of volume** is lower. This means hydrogen tanks need to be huge to contain enough fuel to get into orbit, like the external tank of the Space Shuttle and the relatively chubby looking Ariane 5. This is part of the reason some new designs are using Methane instead of Hydrogen - there's other factors involved in the decision but the low density is part of the equation.

My question is why?

If you ask why hydrogen **GAS** is so light/low-density it's because of the ideal gas laws and how 1 mole of a gas fills the same volume regardless of which gas it is therefore the gas with the smallest molecular mass will be lightest. But that's not why **LIQUID / Cryogenic** Hydrogen is so light / low density. 

The hydrogen atom is very very small so logically it should be pretty easy to compress it down to a tiny size. If it was hydrogen ions I can see how that would be hard to compress because the charge density of a hydrogen + or - ion would be really high because it's so small, but that doesn't explain why the neutral atoms are hard to compress.
