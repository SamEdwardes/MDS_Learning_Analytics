977,977,why is liquid hydrogen so lightorlowdensity,liquid or cryogenic hydrogen for rockets has a very good energy density per gram compared to other common fuels like liquid methane or liquid kerosene but the density of liquid hydrogen is really really low so the energy density per litre of volume is lower this means hydrogen tanks need to be huge to contain enough fuel to get into orbit like the external tank of the space shuttle and the relatively chubby looking ariane 5 this is part of the reason some new designs are using methane instead of hydrogen  theres other factors involved in the decision but the low density is part of the equationmy question is whyif you ask why hydrogen gas is so lightorlowdensity its because of the ideal gas laws and how 1 mole of a gas fills the same volume regardless of which gas it is therefore the gas with the smallest molecular mass will be lightest but thats not why liquid or cryogenic hydrogen is so light or low density the hydrogen atom is very very small so logically it should be pretty easy to compress it down to a tiny size if it was hydrogen ions i can see how that would be hard to compress because the charge density of a hydrogen  or  ion would be really high because its so small but that doesnt explain why the neutral atoms are hard to compresswhy is this,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/d8969a/why_is_liquid_hydrogen_so_lightlowdensity/,why is liquid hydrogen so lightorlowdensity liquid or cryogenic hydrogen for rockets has a very good energy density per gram compared to other common fuels like liquid methane or liquid kerosene but the density of liquid hydrogen is really really low so the energy density per litre of volume is lower this means hydrogen tanks need to be huge to contain enough fuel to get into orbit like the external tank of the space shuttle and the relatively chubby looking ariane 5 this is part of the reason some new designs are using methane instead of hydrogen  theres other factors involved in the decision but the low density is part of the equationmy question is whyif you ask why hydrogen gas is so lightorlowdensity its because of the ideal gas laws and how 1 mole of a gas fills the same volume regardless of which gas it is therefore the gas with the smallest molecular mass will be lightest but thats not why liquid or cryogenic hydrogen is so light or low density the hydrogen atom is very very small so logically it should be pretty easy to compress it down to a tiny size if it was hydrogen ions i can see how that would be hard to compress because the charge density of a hydrogen  or  ion would be really high because its so small but that doesnt explain why the neutral atoms are hard to compresswhy is this
