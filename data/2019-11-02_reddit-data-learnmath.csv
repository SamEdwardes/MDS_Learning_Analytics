1,Re-Introducing r/Bibliographies!,"Hi,

I'm the new mod for /r/bibliographies! I restarted the subreddit after seeing way too many people asking about certain books or topics that sometimes were never addressed . At /r/bibliographies we hope to cater to all your needs! We hold a repository of information that allow learners such as yourself and I learn new topics, such as physics, mathematics, biology, theology or music! We're currently at the level of Multivariable Calculus and not sure where we'll finish. Our posts usually start at the beginner level and head all the way to the graduate level and sometimes beyond! We do need contributors to help us out though. We hope you hop over and contribute. Thanks!",141,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/ak9vmc/reintroducing_rbibliographies/
2,"Man has walked into a casino with 1000$ to play roulette. He decided to play on color and wants to win another thousand. Which would be better, to bet on one color 1000$ at once or bet 500-500$ dollars separately two times?","*I translated this problem from other language and I probably did it not very well.*  


This problem has 2 hints. I understand the first one but struggle on the second.  
Hint #1: Let's say that probability of winning for a color that we choose is p (p < 1/2, because there are zeroes on roulette).   
When we play 2 games there can be 3 outcomes:  
a) We win both games (probability of that is p^(2));  
b) We win one and lose the second (probability of that is 2p(1-p) - probability of winning times probability of losing taken 2 times because there are 2 situations where we lose one game and win second);  
c) We lose both games - (1-p)^(2).  


I completely understand that part.  


Hint #2: Let's say that from starting position to final position winning chance is x, then we can write an equation:   
x = p^(2)\+2p(1-p)x  


I don't get how can we write this equation and I don't understand fully what does it mean. Also, what should I do with this equation?",68,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dqj8ay/man_has_walked_into_a_casino_with_1000_to_play/
3,I guys my post was removed on /r/math so I am posting here How would you guys go about tutoring and improving the math of 9-12 year olds,"To give a little bit of my background about myself I am an 18 year old community college freshmen who throughout high school obtained straight c's in math. I am taking calculus and decided that I would no longer let math be a weakness of mine and decided to go to the math tutoring center for as much time as I could everyday. I would go fairly often but still failed my first test despite putting in 20 hours, I did not get discouraged, I reminded myself that my class drops the lowest test and that I would simply have to keep putting in more effort, by the second test I had clocked in over 100 hours in the tutoring center and had done long hours of math at home. On the second test I got an 87% (due to missing a simple rate of change derivative problem by substituting when I shouldn't have).

I realized that if I hadn't had the tutoring center at school I would have failed math. Seeing the attitudes of my little cousins towards math reminds me of the unhelpful attitude that I had towards the subject my whole life. They view it as a complicated series of numbers. And one of them actually thinks that it is uncool to like / be good at math and that it is only for nerds, the other 2 simply have never experienced success in the subject.

The reason that I was able to learn Calculus fairly well (despite having a very weak base in algebra, geometry, trig etc) is because I hung out with these tutors. The tutors can only get their job if they get an A in the class so I asked all of them for their advice on what I should do and I took all of it. One of them suggested that I read and try to understand the whole book cover to cover which I am doing. Another suggested doing all of the red problems in the book to improve my understanding past the basics, another suggested that I show all of my work thoroughly so that I would never have to fear making mistakes and to check each step constantly. When I first started and wasn't able to get anything right without a tutor next to me, a tutor told me that I would need to struggle through problems and only get help when I had a real question. She told me that math is not a spectator sport and that the only way I was going to learn is by doing it. Every day I would learn some new math concept from a algebra or geometry, precalc or trig that I was unaware of before and I loved the process of learning and the way it was explained. I read [this](https://github.com/kyrylo/coursera-mathematical-thinking/blob/master/lecture-0/background-reading-what-is-mathematics.pdf) which changed my perception a lot as well

I would try every problem and when I got the problem wrong I would ask the tutor why and they would explain the trigonometry and algebra in ways I have never thought of before and it would make perfect sense. I no longer viewed math as a bunch of formulas and numbers but finally had a solid understanding of what they all meant and was disappointed that I was unable to learn this in high school. I might be wrong or maybe I just wasn't listening or was just lazy but I think that math in high school was not taught nearly as well as in college.

I have three younger cousins that I plan on tutoring. They are all having major problems in school due to math and their home life is pretty bad. I always treat them as best as I can since I know that they are usually treated poorly so I do think that they would enjoy spending time with me even if it is math (to them it is not exciting). My plan is to have them struggle through their math problems and explain why the numbers work the way they do in the most cogent and visual way possible. I plan on having them take frequent breaks to avoid burnout. And will probably have them do 1.5 hours of math each time I see them including the breaks. I also plan on trying to introduce 1 basic concept from algebra every time after they have mastered their school work, accompanied by very basic problems with that concept in order to familiarize them with the material ahead of time. I will be using [this](http://msenux2.redwoods.edu/PreAlgText/chapter1.pdf) text book to teach very basic algebra concepts and definitions slowly. Maybe 1 basic concept or definition each time that I see them.

&#x200B;

The oldest (12) does not want to learn math, and it is sad to me because I know that she will most likely regret it down the road, and while she is smart her dislike of school is only going to set her up for failure. She has already started skipping classes. Their parents and all of their brothers and sisters ended up dropping out of high school, and either getting pregnant at 15/16 or doing hard drugs. They now suffer from depression and anxiety, live extremely unhealthy lifestyles and struggle to hold onto jobs. I really do not want these little girls to end up like their parents when they get older, and the only way that I could see them often and be a positive influence on their lives is through math.

There is a fine line between making math imposing and making math fun or bearable, and I am going to have to be very careful walking across that line.

It is obvious to me that the youngest one (9) has a learning disability and she is constantly made fun of for being dumb (by her immediate family) and I am worried that she will develop self esteem issues because of it. For her I plan on teaching in a more kinesthetic way. Which if you have any ideas as to how to do I would love to hear it. I am thinking of using an abacus and maybe even a game of catch.

As per the middle child she actually wants help with math and is fairly intelligent. I will need to approach the subject differently with all 3 of them. And was wondering if you guys had any ideas as to how to do this more specifically.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dqnmq6/i_guys_my_post_was_removed_on_rmath_so_i_am/
4,Could you guys link some good sources to study trigonometry?,"I know there's plenty of sources where to study from, but I don't know which are good and which are not.
For reference, I know basic trig, I know sin, cos, tan, I know the sin rule and understand it, I know the cos rule, but am yet to fully understand it. I would like a source, that would teach trig, dig deep into it, with plenty of proofs.

5,[College] How to avoid being daunted by the work ahead in self-learning as an adult?,"Hi, I am a late learner of college-level math and have only recently caught up on differential calculus and linear algebra. I want to continue learning linear algebra, integral calculus, multivariable+vector calculus and probability theory. But it's hard not to feel daunted by how much I have to learn and feel like it's too much to do, too fast.

6,Why is Joseph Fourier immortalized in mathematics?,"I know a little bit about his work, namely the Fourier series and transform, and his famous work on the heat equation (more generally the equation describing diffusion of any quantity). 
But what else did he do that we regard him in such high esteem today?",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dqpr8d/why_is_joseph_fourier_immortalized_in_mathematics/
7,"If p^2 is even, then p is even. Is proof by contrapositive right?","Hi everyone! So I am trying to self learn a book of analysis (by Steven Lay 4th ed) to prep to apply to an M.S. Math Program and I ran into my very first proof in the book.

If p\^2 is even, then p is even.

At first glance I thought, hmmm maybe it is easier to prove the contrapositive. 

If p is odd, then p\^2 is odd.

This seemed a lot easier, but something about it makes it seem like maybe I did something wrong to prove the original statement. I believe the proof goes like this:

&#x200B;

Assume p is odd, then p = 2k +1 for an integer k.

p = 2k + 1

p\^2 = (2k+1)\^2

p\^2 = 4k\^2 + 4k + 1 (expanding binomial)

p\^2 = 2(2k\^2 + 2k) + 1 (factoring 2 from 4k\^2 + 4k)

p\^2 = 2j + 1 (since integers are closed under multiplication and addition, 2k\^2 + 2k = j where j is another integer) (i'm unsure if closed is the right term here.)

Therefore p\^2 is odd.

Now here is the end of the proof of the contrapositive, but I'm unsure how to link this back to the original statement. Do I then say, (p is odd -> p\^2 is odd) -> (p\^2 is even -> p is even) ? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dqnva2/if_p2_is_even_then_p_is_even_is_proof_by/
8,Math & I were Enemies - A message to Math teachers everywhere,"During my entire scholastic career, I hated math. It wasn't that I hated school although I believed this until the second half of high school. I didn't hate learning, I ***loved*** history & science.  I just hated math. And I hated homework! I was convinced that I'd be working within the music industry the second I graduated high school. Rockstars don't do homework. Math never got anyone a record deal (incredibly naive & stupid, I know, but what else do you expect from a 16-year-old). I did go on to go to school for Audio Engineering which exposed me to the **sick truth** that there was indeed *math in music.* Despite making the deans list during my first two semesters, I was unsuccessful in finishing my degree (financial aid issues combined with a failed class). I'm here to tell you that two years later I've decided to hop back on the horse.  

I recently applied to a forestry program that requires TABE testing. While a lot of the sites I've been using are a bit janky  I have been slowly but surely begun to learn the operations I daydreamed through all those years ago. At first, I didn't run into any issues. Everything was easy until it wasn't. The first question I got wrong was an eye-opener. I was reminded of how math made me feel all those years ago. **It made me feel stupid.** I was angry at first. It was funny because I hadn't experienced such knee-jerk rage since school. It was almost like the scene from It's Always Sunny where mack flips the board in CharDeeMacDennis. Then I was disappointed in myself for failing at something a grade school child could complete, but where I would've just said ""*screw it, Xbox time* ""as a kid or teenager I decided to continue. It also made me realize that a lot of the teachers I had in the past were good mathematicians but terrible math teachers. 

I can't tell you how many times in high school and college I heard the words "" do you guys get it? Pretty easy right?"" always met by dead air and two or three head nods from the gifted kids. If you tell someone something is easy and they don't understand it, you make them feel stupid and discourage inquisition. While it may be a pretty rudimentary concept, the people in a class are there because they don't know the subject being taught. Of course, it's easy for a Dr. in their respective fields, they've been studying it most of their lives and have been teaching it for several years. Most people who aren't inclined in Math don't study it. Therefore if you're teaching it, you're more than likely somewhat mathematically gifted. 

As someone who has the math skills of a seventh-grader, I've got to tell you that math is pretty fun once you understand what you're doing. I was disappointed in the fact that I couldn't do long division, two or three problems and it all came back to me. Subtracting decimals was another one, I understood how to subtract anything that resulted in a positive integer but anything that was supposed to result in a negative was always off. After some frustration and anger that I couldn't direct at anything other than myself/my brain, I realized that if I swapped the places of the larger integer and just subtracted like normal and reverse the sign I'd get the answer the calculator displayed. *Mild extasy.*  **I beat the numbers!** I knew the operation and I'd never let a similar one make me feel dumb again. I'm disappointed as to why I couldn't do this before. Probably because I didn't have the emotional maturity to continue. When the option is frustration, rage, then disappointment or videogames it's an easy choice. 

My message is this. Don't take your natural inclinations for granted and don't try to tell people math is simple. To them, it's not. If you truly want to help children who struggled the way I did, do one unconventional thing. **Weaponize their disdain,** convince them to defeat the numbers. You may love math, but the ones who are struggling despise it. It makes us feel dumb. **Encourage people to make math their bitch**. 

Conquering one's ignorance is the most liberating thing you can do.",128,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dqcmaj/math_i_were_enemies_a_message_to_math_teachers/

I think they're looking for P(x<9), but because I'm approximating I would do P(x<9+0.5)

Turning x = 9.5 into a z-score

S.D = sqrt(12.1125) 

S.D = 3.48

z = (x - mean)/S.D

z = (9 - 12.25)/3.48

z = -0.79

P(z<-0.79) = 1 - P(z>-0.79)

= 1 - 0.2148

= 0.7852

Therefore the probability is approximately 79%. Do you agree with these steps? I wasn't sure whether to go with x = 9 based on the # of passengers *not* showing up.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dqqvk0/intro_to_stats_not_sure_if_im_interpreting_this/

I take the derivatives of each and get:

dx/dt = -e ^(-t) (cos(t) + sin(t)), and dy/dt= e^(-t)(cos(t) - sin(t))

I put them into the equation of Arc Length for parametric equations which is: (integral is from 0 to pi/2)

\*\*s = INTEGRAL( \[dx/dt\]^(2)\+ \[dy/dt\]^(2))^(1/2) dt

So I then get:

\*\*s = INTEGRAL( \[ -e^(-t)(cos(t) + sin(t))\]^(2)\+ \[e^(-t) cos(t) - sin(t))\]^(2) )^(1/2)  dt BOLD

I expand the inside to get:

s=INTEGRAL( ( e^(-2t)) \[  -cos^(2)(t) - 2sin(t)cos(t) - sin^(2)(t) + cos^(2)(t) - 2sin(t)cos(t) + sin^(2)(t) \] )^(1/2) dt

I simplify to get:

s=INTEGRAL( ( e^(-2t)) \[ - 2sin(t)cos(t) - 2sin(t)cos(t) \] )^(1/2) dt

And further simplify to get:

s=INTEGRAL ( e^(-t)) ( - 4sin(t)cos(t) )^(1/2) dt

So now I'm stuck because not only do I have a negative in square root, the answer shows I should be getting an integral that looks like:

*s= -(2)**^(1/2)* *\*\*INTEGRAL (e**^(-t)**\*\*) (-1) dt, <----italics*

54,can't solve the integral (or antiderivative) of csc squared,"So, what I have to do is the  ∫ 2\*sin^(-2)(π/4 - 3x) dx

I solved in order to apply the power rule, which is (A^(n))' = A^(n-1)\*A'\*n

This led me to the final result: 2/3 \*  1/((cos(π/4 - 3x)\*sen(π/4 - 3x)) or 2/3 \* cos-1\*sen-1. Well the correct result is: 2/3 \* cot(π/4 - 3x).

 Basically in my equation I should have cos^(1) instead of cos^(-1) to make the cot but I can't see how that is possible since I have to add 1/cos to the outside of the integral in order to add cos to the inside, to make the \[(A^(n))' = A^(n-1)\*A'\*n\] formula possible.

If you can't understand what I'm saying I've written in paper:  [https://imgur.com/a/iPPoTaj](https://imgur.com/a/iPPoTaj) 

If you still can't help me, just solve the integral your way but still applying: ∫ A^(n-1)\*A'\*n = A^(n) \+ b

For instance x^(4)+64 is always composite and it turns out that x^4 + 64 = (x^2 - 4x + 8)(x^2 + 4x + 8).

So I couldn't help but wonder.   If p(x) in Z[x] is composite for every integer value of x, must it be the case that p(x) factors over Z[x] into polynomials f(x) and g(x) with |f(x)| >= 2 and |g(x)| >= 2 for all integers x.   

Similarly, if p(x) in Z[x] is a perfect square for every integer value of x, must p(x) be a perfect square as an element of Z[x]?

If those statements hold, are more general statements true as well?   For instance if p(x) is the product of at least 3 non-zero, non-unit integers for every integer x, does it follow that p(x) can be factored into three polynomials in Z[x] which are never equal to -1,0, or 1 for integer x?",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dq3w64/polynomials_which_are_composite_at_the_integers/

I did that..

(3/2) becomes (2/3)

(Square root of 3) becomes (2 x square root of 3) and the bottom stays as (3) because 3 times 1 is 3.

(Removed from r/math even though it not homework, but just something I came up with and wanted to discuss with others)","To preface this, I’m just doing this in my free time and never did this before and didn’t look up any formulas or anything.

I saw this scene in a movie I watched last night where a woman drops a rock down a deep cave and it takes a while to hear the sound of the rock hitting the bottom. So it got me thinking.

Let’s say she’s 1.5 meters tall (5 feet) and she drops the rock at head level.

It takes 3 seconds for the sound to be heard.

So I took the values here and did this. Let me know if you think it’s right or wrong and what you would do differently.

Gravity=9.8m/s^2
Speed of sound=343m/s
Time to hear=3 seconds

If sound traveled at 343m/s for 3 seconds then:
343*3=1,029 meaning that’s 1,029 meters.

Then I took this:
9.8*3=29.4
29.4^2=864.36 meters.

Then I took the difference of gravity and sound
864.36-1,029=-164.64

So my estimate for the distance is 164.64 meters or 540.16 feet.

90,Stuck in Hell.... playing a math video game,"I'm an undergrad math student and a big fan of 3blue1brown on YouTube. I saw Grant Sanderson made a level for an indie math game and I was intrigued. The game is insanely difficult and this level takes the cake... To explain, the idea is you have a calculator UI and you need to calculate 666 but can only use operators the devil has contrived to be obscure. So like maybe a function will multiply by 2 and subtract 4, or concatenate the inputs (there are unary and binary functions). It's called [the devil's calculator](https://www.cinqmarsmedia.com/devilscalculator/). 

In Sanderson's level, there's one unary function and one binary function, and the goal is to calculate 40 using both at least once. After hours of agonizing, I got that the unary function returns the number of ways you can write the input as the sum of 2 squares. Mocking that up in javascript, I came up with something like this (I'm a novice programmer):

    function sumtwosquares(n)={
    b=Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
    c=0;
    for (i=-b;i<=b;i++){
    for (l=-b;l<=b;l++){
    if (i*i+l*l==n){c++}}}
    return c;
    }

The binary function though, I have no idea. I feel like I've tried everything. Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention, the 9 and the decimal point can't be used, either to collect data or in the solution. I posted a [screenshot.](https://imgur.com/gallery/QNPEBEw) I guess it's kind of hard to explain without playing the game, but you collect data and look for patterns (I'll use Y as the stand-in function operator). There are definitely some clues:

&#x200B;

* 0Y0 -- Error
* nY0 -- Error
* nYn=1
* 0Yn=0

So it seems like something with division is going on. 

* 1Y2=2
* 1Y3=3
* 1Yn=n
* 2Y1=2
* 3Y1=3
* nY1=n

So it seems symmetrical like addition and 1Yn=n. But then

* 2Y3=12
* 2Y4=2
* 2Y5=22
* 2Y6=3
* 2Y7=32
* 2Y8=4
* 3Y4=13
* 3Y5=112
* 3Y6=2
* 3Y7=23

But I never understand why, for when P is **false**, the implication will be **true**. I don't even need to care about Q. Once P is false, P implies Q is true. That's the one conclusion from the Truth Table that I can't make sense of.

If Mars is made of cotton candy, then I have a billion dollars.

Well, Mars ain't made of cotton candy, so that's false. Then the implication is true. What's the meaning of it, though?

From what I've gathered, ""if Mars is made of cotton candy"" is false, then the implication is true. But I know it's not because I don't own a trillion dollars.

Here is my opinion on the question:

There are 4 ways to have a full house: if there is  a 3 of club, a 3 of heart, a 10 of heart or a 10 of club on the table.

So there are 4 outs.

Plus, I can also obtain a full house there are two jack after the river (one jack is picked turn, and one jack at the river)

There are 4 \* 2 \* 45 + 3\*2 ways to have a full jack after the river, but I'm not sure.

3\*2 for the possible runner runner with two jack.

4\*2\*45 for the possible full with a 3 of club, a 3 of heart, a 10 of heart or a 10 of club on the table.

117,"I'm a university student studying mathematics to become a math teacher. One task I have to do is to solve a complexe problem only with tools a fifth-grade child would understand, and I'm struggling hard.","> A magican does the following party trick: He has eight playing cards with one number written on it each - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. The magican gets blindfolded while a guest flips over a card and shuffles them all. The guest then lays them in a 2x4 grid with just the flipped card face down (all other cards are still face up). The face down card is now considered a ""0"". The guest now sums up both 4-digit numbers and forms the cross sum of that result over and over again until it's a 1-digit cross sum. With that final number, the magican can now tell exactly which card lays face down.

Example: 3629 + 7*84 = 10713. The cross sum of that is 12, and the cross sum of that 3. When the guest tells the magican that it's 3, the magican can correctly describe the face down card as '5'.

While this is a ludicrous task to ask a fifth-grade student and probably the worst party trick ever, I've got two questions: HOW does it work, and WHY does it work?

Trying some numbers, I've found out that the final cross sum is different depending on what card lays face down - e.g. the cross sum is always 8 when the face-down card is '9', or the cross sum is always 2 when the face-down card is '6'.

124,“When will I ever use this in real life?”,"Brace yourselves, I tend to overexplain:

When I was in high school I remember every year from Algebra, to Geometry, to Calc, the most common rhetorical question was condescendingly summoned to the middle of quite literally every lecture for nearly every day.. “ *Why do we even need to learn this?* *when will this ever apply to anyone’s life?* “... this is usually followed by the teacher giving a vague example of something very basic, and often wouldn’t *stick* because it was usually identical to the “molly buys 300 giraffes” word problems. 

I personally have always had a natural feel for math, so I would often ignore the banter, finish my assignments and move on with my day. However there were times I too myself would wonder how most of the advanced math was going to transfer over into real life, and well.. recently I had a wake up call.. 

So fast forward my life, 5 years out of high school. I’m a 2 semester college dropout, who has been working the last 4 years in between restaurant jobs and manual labor jobs. Most of my manual labor jobs were along the lines of “here pull this wheel til you see 100 foot, and mark a line on the ground”, or “pass me that wrench”.  Still not much is transferring over from high school, besides, basic counting.. in which case I could’ve dropped out of high school at 12, and began my life as a tape measure guru. 

But before I get too far off track, what you’ve all been reading for: 

~6 months ago I began working as a helper at a pipe fabrication shop. They started my wage a bit over average because I had “manual labor experience” and they said if I have a pipe fitter willing to teach me I could move up some more” which luckily, I did. My fitters at the time is a very old Laotian man who is waiting to retire. He isn’t a fan of the company and was ready to leave but told me he wouldn’t leave the company til I was a “top dog” fitter. Like him. The first thing he taught me to read was the blueprints. I was a stud at this because when breaking things down, it all becomes very simple addition, and subtraction, and ability to read x y z direction. So this was a breeze to me. But the pipefitting hand son portion was not so easy. But after a couple of months of getting the basics down, he began to show me tricks. Tricks that any person who remembers anything about geometry from high school, would be able to look at, and instantly begin applying that knowledge to real life. Things like, diameter, radius and circumference of a circle. I couldn’t tell you how many times I asked myself why I should care so much about circles. And measuring them. 

As time flies I begin realizing that I’ve gotten the grasp of pipefitting. So my fitter tests me out to see if I can do it. At first things are shaky, but eventually I get it, things look great, I internally celebrate. And then I fit again and again.. 

I was told numerous times to become top class fitter it takes about 2 years of working under a good top class fitter. I knocked that down to 6 months. And can accredit half of it to my fitter, and the other half to the stupid things in high school math classes I thought would never transfer over to real life. I started this job as a gaming nerd, who could barely handle a tool, to a now, gaming nerd who makes over twice the starting wage of my job, can barely handle a wrench, and fits pipe faster than people who have been doing this constantly for the last 15 years. 

If any of you did take the time to read, thank you. I hope this serves some inspiration. Sorry it’s a bit all over the place, I have severe ADHD, and am terrible at putting my thoughts into words.

140,Differentiating a Quadratic x^2+6x+5,"Hey!

I have an example equation in my textbook for differentiating a quadratic, but I don't fully understand how the author got from one point to another. Can you assist?

f(x)= (x\^2) + 6x + 5 , df / dx = 2x + 6. What happened to the 6x + 5 (bx + c) ?

Using nx\^(n-1) I see how we got the 2x ( 2x\^(2-1) ), from ax\^2. I imagine the + 6 (from 2x + 6) is the n value of 6x (bx), but then what happens to the x + 5?

\- Thoughts, do we take the 6x and make it 6x\^(1) meaning that n =1 so 6 1x\^(1-1) so x\^0, thus getting 6 \* 1?- I have 0 thoughts on what happens with the c value

:/

Thank you!  


EDIT:  


The full equation is actually a chain rule example of h(x) = f ( g(x) ) = ln ( x\^2 + 6x +5 ) or ln(u) when u = x\^2 + 6x + 5.

The right way to solve it was to begin by establishing that:

1) Post height / man's height = (post to man distance + man to shadow tip distance) / (man to shadow tip distance).

2) Post height \* man to shadow tip distance - man's height \* man to shadow tip distance = Man's height \* (post to man distance)

From there, it was pretty easy to figure out the calculus component.

&#x200B;

Where I got stuck is that I began by creating a Great Insane Diagram of overlapping triangles, trying to calculate angle measures using the law of sines and cosines. It simply didn't occur to me to use the simpler relation. That's probably because those rules are top of mind for me, as they were covered heavily in the placement exam work I did to qualify for calculus, while the simpler relation that was actually necessary wasn't covered at all. It's also because my intuition was primed by prior problems in the same set, in which the right approach was to use the Pythagorean theorem.

What I'm realizing is that in math, it's not enough to know all these relationships. You have to have some intuitions about which ones to try applying. And it's probably important to start with the simplest approaches before trying anything more complicated. This, of course, is not just a problem for math, but for many areas of life. In programming projects, it's been a great lesson for me to realize that it's almost always better to use a library rather than to write original code unless you have a reason not to.

So my question is, how do you simplify your intuitions for mathematical problem-solving? How do you go beyond mastering a big collection of tools to actually prioritizing which one's you'll try first on a given problem?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dps1m1/how_to_simplify_my_intuitions_calc_trig_related/

On to my main question: I have to do an exploration/research on a particular topic in Math as part of my final IB grade. But firstly, I have to come up with a topic to research/explore on, which I am having trouble doing. I do read some articles on math theories and concepts (very interesting) but they were mainly on number theory (something that my teacher told me not to do). I have been researching online for one, but am having quite a bit of trouble doing so :( .  The thing is, the topic must be in depth enough to fulfil the HL Math syllabus and go slightly above it, but be contained within 12 pages. 

I'm mainly looking into calculus to explore upon, such as partial and fractional differentiations (which are pretty cool) but I dont think there's a real life application of it? (mandatory to have a real world context)

Hence, I will really appreciate it if you guys would give me some suggestions into something I can explore on (i really want to enjoy this and gain something from it, not just for the marks). And hopefully I will have a vast knowledge about this awe-inspiring world of mathematics!

Yes im a dummy in math, cheers to everyone trying to solve our Smartie Mystery:D

What i thought, but is probably very dumb lol

12.5% • 12.5% • 12.5% • 87.5%
divided by 4 smarties 12.5% •4 = 50%

I'm tentatively interested in computer science. So, I'm thinking doing math on my own, alongside studying for IT certifications, and learning programming would be a good goal.

Say I have a series RC circuit, and I want to find the transfer function. After rearranging the equations I end up with:

Vout/Vin = (R * 1/(j * omega * C))/(R + 1/(j * omega * C))

The simplification is to multiply both numerator and denominator by j*omega*C to get:

Vout/Vin = R/(j * R *omega * C + 1)

I am currently trying to refresh my euclidean geometry knowledge from high school from brilliant.org, and came across symmedians. The construction of symmedians is introduced as:

Let ABC be a triangle inscribed in a circle with centre O. Draw tangents of the circle (O) at B and C , and they meet at point P. Then AP is the symmedian of triangle ABC.

The construction is justified by: Let AM be the median of triangle ABC . Let D be the intersection of line AP and the circle (O). Let E be the foot of perpendicular from O to AD . Then E is the midpoint of segment AD. OEBP is a concylic quadrilateral and angle BEP = angle BAC. Also angle BDA= angle BCA so triangles BED and ABC are similar. But then it says that But E and M are midpoints of AD and BC , respectively; hence, triangle BDA and triangle MCA are similar.My question is: How is the similarity of the latter two triangles assured from the existence about the midpoints?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dp3bpi/question_about_similarity_of_triangles/

238,(High school self-study) Struggling with Calculus by Spivak,"EDIT: Thank you all for the wonderful replies, I'm sorry I could not reply to all of them, but they have been very helpful and encouraging :)  


Im a high school senior (not from the us) and we've just finished a basic calculus, which I found pretty unsatisfactory. We had it for one semester, it was a lot of rote learning (that's the term I think) and computations. 

 So I took the initiative to study calculus for myself. I came across Calculus by Michael Spivak through online recommendations, it receives a lot of acclaim so I thought I'd give it a try. I am able to follow the explanations in the book and I do find them quite nice and satisfactory unlike my previous exposure to the subject, but the problems are quite a hurdle for me. I'm not mathematically inclined although I did okay with my previous course, which  I now realize means absolutely nothing. Moreover, I haven't had formal introduction to proofs which is probably what's hurting the most. Most of the time I have no idea how to even start the problems, they even seem to look scarier as the problem numbers go up. I had read a warning when looking up this book, that learning calculus through it without an instructor is like being thrown in a river to learn how to swim. And it does kinda feel that way. 

I would like to push through with this book, because I do enjoy Spivak's approach to Calculus (explaning why things work the way they do and why they make sense). Though I would also like to make this less painful for myself. Any suggestions on doing this? I'm planning to get another resource, maybe an introductory analysis book (I have read somewhere that they are related). 

TL;DR: I'm struggling with self-studying Calculus by Spivak and I need suggestions of other resources to supplement the book.",87,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/donu1p/high_school_selfstudy_struggling_with_calculus_by/

240,How do I calculate my parasitic alien colony's expansion rate?," 

Greetings Earthlings!

So,  I just invented a parasitic lifeform designed to eradicate all life on  planet earth (As you do) but ran into aproblem. And since almost an  intire percent of your inteligent population, is quite adiquite at  mathematics. I figured i might as well save my mental exersion, by  asking you guys for help! \^-\^

The  life forms in question come in several species (Don't know witch one  I'll use yet. TeeHee<3 )Species 0.1 aka MURDERBLOBS reproduces  asexually, by cloning itself every few years. And each clone, once  formed, takes a few years to reach sexual maturity. I currently have the  reproductive cloning interval set to once a year. And the time needed  to reach sexuall maturaty set to 7 years. Though I might change that, so  I need to be able to acount for such changes.

Then  there's the second species... oh boy. Species 0.3 aka BLOODAPES II  ELECTRIC BOOGALOO reproduces through male to female sexuall intercores  (I know. Disgusting right?!) Currently the Bloodapes2 can breed only  once a year, due to a 1 year long pregnancy. Once born, the bloodape  will take 7 years to reach sexuall maturity (for both males and  females). Its a 50/50 wether the offspring is a male or a female. And  same as with the Musrerblobs, certen details might change. Such as the  pregnancy duration, sexual maturation and male to female birth ratio.

The  third species is... almost as disgusting. Species 0.5 aka DEATHPUPPIES  reproduces through male to female sexuall intercorce -\_-  Same as with  the Bloodapes2, the Deathpuppies can breed only once a year, due to a 1  year long pregnancy. Once born, the ofspring will take 7 years to reach  sexuall maturaty. The thing with this species though, is they can't give  birth to males. And with today's current spacegass prices, I can't  really send more than two specimens. So the male I send over in the  initial pod, will be the only male in the colony. At least untill I can  save up enough spacebucks to send a second male. The other issue is that  one male can only ejaculate once every 6 secounds, and needs atleast 2  hours of sleep per day. So eventually, there are going to be so many  females, that not all of them will get a chance to breed each year. I  need to know how long it will take before I have to send a second male.

Also  my time frame might change. How many 0.1s can i get in 50 or 100 years?  How long will it take to get one milion 0.3s? There are other possible  variations as well. What if they get some weird mutations like twins or  liking pineapple on pizza? How do I acount for mortality rates or  existencial questions?

So in  short. I would aprechiate if you guys, would share your proces for how  you calculate parasite-colony expansion rates. Since I heard that you  got one of your lesser parasitic species, to consider a mars colony. (It  was the... humans? Wasn't it?) I bet you dolphins are pretty stoked  with that XD

P.S. Assuming you send 1 human male and 1 human female. What would the equation look like?

P.P.S.  Is it true that this h2o stuff contains oxygen? I need to know, because  all the species I created, are extremly inbred. And therefore deathly  allergic to oxygen.

I've measured how much food the widget fills each sample container - 100 containers in the sample.

How do i calculate the tolerance/precision of the widget operation?

Since i can adjust the weight of the output, accuracy is not a great concern because i know i can adjust the mean output weight to meet what is desired.

Repeatability is obviously important and is what i want to calculate.

If i have a mean weight of 1000g. My heaviest weight is 1080g and lightest weight is 980g. This gives me a range of 100g. Does this give me a precision of 10%?

So i can adjust the mean weight to be 970g, and therefore have the desired weight of 1000g +/- 5%.

I can't decide on whether i'm missing something obvious or i'm trying to over complicate it.

EDIT: Or is it just a standard tolerance calculation? max error / expected value.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/doxlzy/how_to_calculate_the_toleranceprecision_of_a/

The premise is that there is 7 people, 1 of whom does not belong into a said category and the other 6 try to determine who it is and eliminate that person each round. After each elimination the group votes as a whole whether or not to go on. More rounds gives more chances to eliminate the mole but also to be eliminated yourself. 

If you fail to eliminate the mole, the mole gets all the money, if the mole is eliminated, the remaining members split the money.

Lets say you are one of the 6 contestants and assume that who is eliminated is completely random; at how many people left is the best place to stop? Not just the best probability for eliminating the mole but also maximizing the amount of money you make as well as balancing it with the risk of being eliminated

If possible what are the probabilities at each number of people for:

having the mole eliminated, amount of money earned (in regards to probability of mole), and chance of being eliminated.

This question was totally fine until I broke it down. I'll just show the work and explain the confusion as it's shown. 

We know that the answer to the question is in the single thousands, so we need four spaces to visualise what possible digits can be put in each slot. 

 _ _ _ _ <-

So let's begin with all the possible numbers for the last slot. The numbers have to be even so the last space must be a 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. So we can safely say there's 5 possible numbers for that space. 

->_ _ _ 5

Now let's move the the first slot. We can have any number here except for 0 and whatever number is in the last slot. So it should just be 8
possibilities right? Well who even knows? If we assume the last slot can be 0,2,4,6,8 then what happens when the last slot is 0? Now there's a 20% chance that the first slot can be 9 possibilities.

Fuck me...

Now I have never been taught this by anyone, so I don't know if I can even use this method (which is why I'm here) but I'm gonna elaborate on how I think I can get around this problem.

I basically just force one set to have the last numbers limited to 2,4,6,8 and create another set where the last number can only be 0.  Fill out the two sets and we get: 8874 and 9871

8x8x7x4=1792     9x8x7x1=504

Finally I just added them together to get 2296 total possible 4 digit numbers that have no repeating digits. 

This seems like the logical way to solve this and I can't find the answer on google anywhere. I just don't know if it's as simple as breaking them apart and putting them back together.

Anyway I'm not engaging with this community to point fingers and complain, I'm here because I want your help building a curriculum that works for me.

I don't even know where to start, but I have an idea about where I'd like to end, somewhere in the realm of advanced physics. I have always enjoyed conceptual physics, and have long known that I cannot fully appreciate the branch of science unless I engage with the mathematics head-on. I'd like to follow a thorough curriculum, something that develops from simple arithmetic ---> quantum wave functions ---> beyond! A little probability and statistics here, maybe some computational and pure mathematics there. I want to understand it all. Obviously there's a lot of space in between those arrows and ideas. I need your help organizing my studies so I can fill those gaps. Can r/learnmath help me become a competent mathematian?

I already have plenty of useful resources at my disposal: pencil, pens, graphing calculator, graphing paper, lined paper, internet, smart devices, and an insatiable desire to learn. All I need is a path to follow...

Are there any comprehensive online courses (free or otherwise) that cover all my needs and offer progress checks? Should I just forget about orderly planning and instead dive into Kahn Academy? Am I going about this all wrong? Are there any games that might be useful?

348,"[Differential Equations] Intuition on 2ndOrder ODE, and causation","This might be a very not well defined question, but I honestly can't tell if it has an answer.

Let's say I have a 2ndOrder ODE, x(t) st **aD^(2)x+bDx+c=0**. Maybe a,b,c are functions, maybe not, I'll ignore that. Possibly inspired by physics but I usually of it in terms of an acceleration. There's position and velocity, which would remain unchanged except for an acceleration that causes a change. So the ""true"" equation is: **aD^(2)x=-bDx-c**. Is there any reason this makes sense or is it completely arbitrary? Couldn't I instead have thought the ""true"" equation was: **bDx=-aD^(2)x-c**, and that we have a position and an acceleration, and a velocity is THE cause in change of both? If that makes sense why does it make sense?

I think maybe part of the reason is that usually a(t)=/=0 for all t, so D^(2)x is always determined. But also because 2ndOrder ODE solutions are fully determined by (x,x')(0), but would they often be fully determined by (x,x'')(0) just as well?

If I try to put this in more discrete algorithmic terms, I think in terms of the Euler method.

Then the ODE basically says: (x,x')(t+dt)=(x(t)+x'(t)dt, x'(t)+(bDx-c)/a \* dt). So at every instant we have a state (x,x')(t), and at every moment the change in x is determined by x'(t) and the change in x'(t) is caused by some form with some equation. 

However would this method give the same result? The state is (x,x'')(t). And the update equation is given by the equation: **bDx=-aD^(2)x-c**. So (x,x'')(t+dt)=(x(t)+(-ax''(t)-c)/b \* dt, (\*)/dt). Where this (\*) is just a complicated way to indirectly say (x'(t)-x'(t-dt)). That complicated way being (-ax''(t)-c)/b - (-ax''(t-dt)-c/b. Is this just as sensible?

If we have an nthOrder ODE, why should we say that the cause of change is a the nth derivative that is given by some law aD^(n)x=(...)?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/doe609/differential_equations_intuition_on_2ndorder_ode/

&#x200B;

Defective pixels. For warranty purposes analysts want to model the number of defects on a screen of the new tablet they are manufacturing. Let X = the number of defective pixels per screen. If X can be modeled by:

|x = 	# of defective pixels|0|1|2|3|4 or more|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P(X = x)|0.95|0.04|0.008|0.002|0|

I know this is 0.062. because 0.95 \* 0 + 0.040 \* 1 + 0.008 \* 2 + 0.002 \* 3 = 0.062

**b) what is the standard deviation of the number of defective pixels per screen?**

372,Formula to make factoring quadratics easier,"So recently we learned how to factor quadratic polynomials at school. The method we were taught was to find two numbers such that they added to equal *b* and multiplied to equal *ac*.

For example, if we have the following polynomial,

2*x*² + 3*x* \+ 1

The two numbers would be 2 and 1.

2 + 1 = 3

2 × 1 = 2

Then we separate the equation using these two numbers and so on.

2*x*² + 2*x* \+ *x* \+ 1

2*x*(*x*² + 1) + (*x* \+ 1)

(2*x* \+ 1)(*x* \+ 1)

I found this tedious and impractical for larger *a*, *b* and *c* values and knew that there had to be an easier way. So I defined these two numbers as *n*₁ and *n*₂, and used the relationships we were taught to end up with this formula:

*n* = (*b* ±√*b*² - 4*ac*) / 2

I've tried the formula and it works (as far as I'm aware), but what confused me was that it's so similar to the Quadratic formula. Later on, I realized that it *is* the Quadratic formula, but multiplied by -*a*.

I think it's unlikely that this is just a coincidence and I'm missing something. Can someone point me in the right direction?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/do4es7/formula_to_make_factoring_quadratics_easier/

431,Discrete Math Pigeon Hole Problem,"Hey guys, I was wondering if you could help me out on a problem i'm trying to understand.

""Consider a group of 10 people ( where each pair are either friends or strangers). Show that there is either a subgroup of 4 mutual friends or a subgroup of 3 mutual strangers.""

I'm solving it using :

Person A

Group X - friends with person A

Group Y - strangers with person A

And one of the groups has at least 4 or more people (9 pigeons (people), 2 holes (groups) ).

&#x200B;

I came up with 3 situations for group X if it contains 4 people:

A)  if none of them are friends then you have a mutual group of 4 strangers in group X.

B)  if two of them are friends then you have a mutual group of 3 friends (including person A) in group X.

C)  if three of them are friends then you have a mutual group of 4 friends (including person A) in group X.

&#x200B;

So... what if we have situation B) wouldn't this problem not work?

&#x200B;

for group Y if it contains 4 people:

A)  if none of them are friends then you have a mutual group of 4 strangers in group Y.

B)  if two of them are friends then the other two people in the group could either friends or strangers, in this case you can't determine if there are 3 mutual strangers  (including person A) because the other two people could be friends which doesn't make them all mutual strangers.

C) if three of them are friends then you could have 3 mutual friends and the other two (the fourth person and person A) are mutual strangers... which also doesn't work.

&#x200B;

So I feel like you cannot show that there is always a subgroup of 4 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers...

433,MATH QUESTION PLEASE HELP US LOL,"Hi

&#x200B;

So trying to figure out, if anyone can do the math for us please cause am confused.. how much money is owed.

&#x200B;

Here's the situation:

I live with 3 other people in a house that we are renting. So 4 of us in here including me.

Usually, we send the monthly rent $1600 ($400 from each of us) to ""Tom"" who is the one responsible for sending the monthly rent off to the landlord or real estate agent. Rent is due on the 16th of every month.

So we paid this month (Octobers) rent to Tom, couple weeks ago. Or so we thought.

Just yesterday my other flatmate received a message from the landlord asking ""Where is the rent money? It has now been 2 weeks and have not received anything"". They message also said that we have until Wednesday (3 days from now) to pay the full amount of we may face eviction. Ugh..

&#x200B;

Shocked, We asked Tom what the hell happened to the money. He brought us into his room and said he was ""in trouble"" and had to spend it for something but he couldn't tell us. He also told us he has lost his job so has no money. But is starting his new job on Wednesday...

Anyway, we decided it be best if the other 3 (who do pay the rent) put up another $1600 to cover the month's rent, as it would be better to pay it rather than get evicted and go through the hassle of trying to find another place. Tom had no money so couldn't chip in again obv.

&#x200B;

The deal is Tom has to pay the entire months rent for next month, which is due on the 16th. 

&#x200B;

So do we lost money here? Or is Tom paying nexts months rent in full all by himself covering the money lost?

434,"Addition, multiplication, powers... then what?","Hi all, was thinking about this recently and wasn't sure what this area of maths this would be or what I need to google to find out more.

Here are my uneducated  thoughts:

Each operation is just repeating the last one a number of times. I.e. 3 * 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 , 4^5 = 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 *4. So it follows that the next operation would be repeatedly raising a number to it's own power. At this point though, Unlike repeating multiplication, something like x ^ x ^ x is ambiguous since (x ^ x ) ^ x is not equal to x ^ ( x ^  x). I think the former makes more sense to use just because it stays a little smaller.

At this point, it seems like a good idea to number these operations. It seems nice though not to start with addition. Using <n> as notation for the nth operation.  

<0> : Does nothing. A kind of a 'identity function' (not sure if that's the right word)  
<1> : unit addition. Adds 1 to a number.  
x<2>y : Addition. Repeats unit addition y times.  
x<3>y : Multiplication. repeats addition of x to x, y times. adds x to iteself y times.  
x<4>y :  Powers. Repeats Multiplication of x by x, y times.  
x<5> y : repeats raiseing x to the x, y times.  
ect.

As n gets bigger x<n>y starts to get very big.
I named in my head 100<100>100 a googolOp (short for googol operation)

Also worth thinking about, but I haven't made much progress: what would be Implied by n being not an integer. I.e. x<3.5>y.

Anyhow, thanks for reading if you got this far. What do I need to look up to find more about this?

435,Why are there so many bad math teachers?,"I've had 3 excellent math teachers in my entire schooling experience (from elementary to college), and they really made the difference for me in terms of interest. I hate it when professors not only go incredibly fast and throw a bunch of notes for you to consume, but also present the information poorly (leaving you to google everything yourself anyway). As much as I find the subject important and fascinating to explore, the majority of the negative experiences make me question learning from institutions further. For most subjects, I have a hit or miss 50/50 liking of the instructor, but for math I've noticed an obvious majority of teachers I've had simply don't care about the students' comprehension

Edit: On a more positive note, the professors/teachers who try their best to improve and cultivate curiosity in students are some of the most influential/important people ever, and I'm sure they know that based on feedback. In the future, I hope we can give teachers what they deserve and invest more in our education system.  I dislike the idea of people thinking that they're ""bad at math"" due to the shame surrounding failures in this aspect and hope we can encourage environments for failure and experimentation.

436,[University (Discrete?)] Countable Infinities and Proof by Contradiction using Diagonalism,"I've been watching videos grinding backwards from Godel's Incompleteness Theorem because I'm trying to understand it by proving it to myself. (Which I'm aware is biting off more than I can probably chew.)

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3PwEXk67Wg&list=PLlwsleWT767dwRXyAyL0-63ON6cCOXY8E&index=1) is the video [playlist] I've been trying to follow through. (You don't have to watch, just... for posterity?)

It explains the use of Cantor's Diagonalization as a proof by contradiction that a given set cannot be mapped to the countable set of natural numbers.

My concern here is that it seems to me you could absolutely use the same logic to prove that a subset of natural numbers is uncountable.

Presume there's a list of the ""countable"" infinite set of natural numbers.
We choose a novel bijection, consisting of the natural index mapping to an equivalent natural number plus 111x10^floor((log10N)) (which is a stupid programmatic way to say the same number, but with 111 in front of it.)

1 = 1111

2 = 1112

3 = 1113

4 = 1114

5 = 1115

And so on. 
If it were countable, you could do the diagonalization to make a new number that could not be on that list.
(i.e that 2225 would never have been reached.)

It seems paradoxical that a subset of the natural set is uncountable while the set is countable, but I'm reasonably certain I'm failing to catch something here. Maybe I'm defining my second set in a way that I'm not supposed to manipulate natural numbers?

The trouble I'm having with this is interfering with my ability to accept things like the insolubility of the halting problem. I'm not sure it's the only thing, but it's what's needling me right now, so I thought I'd post here and ask for a thought audit before I pass out.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dnqnca/university_discrete_countable_infinities_and/
437,[Arithmetic] I can't figure out why the book says this is the interest rate.," [https://imgur.com/a/3fztL0v](https://imgur.com/a/3fztL0v) 

Not homework, reading a bunch of articles to make a history of math presentation.

It says that the owner of the blank ticket gets 1 pound every year, and there is an interest rate of 6% a year.

Apparently 1 pound is 20 shillings is 12 pence.

And that some owners of the blank tickets sold them to others for 6 pounds and 5 shillings, and that this constituted ""an effective interest rate of over 14%""

&#x200B;

My calculations:

The ticket is compounding by 6% each year and gets one pound added to it. After 16 years this turns out to be around 6161 pence. I wrote a for loop to do this, I don't know these formulas.

The owner of the new ticket paid 6 pounds and 5 shillings, or 1500 pence. Thus his net profit after 16 years is 4661.

So it is like he is making a loan for 16 years. The interest rate I calculated by this formula:

loan\*(k)\^16 = profit 

=> 1500\*(k)\^16 = 4661

and k turns out to be around 1.09. 

Ok so maybe he's talking about simple interest (which would be strange), so the formula is

loan + loan\*k\*16 = profit

k turns out to be around 13%.

460,Discrete Math Pigeon Hole Help,"Hello, I have this question from my discrete math textbook that I am having a lot of trouble understanding the solution.

This is a pigeon hole problem:

Suppose a team X plays 18 games in a two-week 14-day period, and plays at least one game a day.

Show that there is a period of days in which exactly 9 games were played.

&#x200B;

Would anyone be able to dumb this down as much as possible for me?

Solution:
Let S = {s1, s2,...,s14} where si is the number of games X played from the first day to the ith day. Then s14 = 18, and all the si are distinct. Let T = {t 1, t2,...,t14} where ti = si + 9. Then t14 = 18 + 9 = 27, and the t i are distinct. 
Together S and T have 14 + 14 = 28 numbers, which lie between 1 and 27. By the Pigeonhole Principle, two of the numbers must be equal. However the entries in S and the entries in T are distinct. 
Thus there is sj ∈ S and t n ∈ T such that sj = t k = sk + 9. Therefore, 9 = sj − sn = number of games played in days k + 1, k + 2,...,j − 1, j",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dnl9wl/discrete_math_pigeon_hole_help/

462,Proof in hyperbolic space,"Hey guys. I've been trying to solve the problem or exercise for a while now. I have somewhat of an idea for an attempt buy I usually get stuck at the same place. Here goes:

*Prove that in Lobachevskian geometry, the segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is shorter than half the triangle's third side.* 

The chapter this problem is in concerns Saccheri Quadrilaterals (SQ). I've proven that in Lobachevskian space, the summit of an SQ is longer than the base. So then what I (think I) want to do is construct a SQ with the base being twice the segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle and the summit being the 3rd side of the triangle. 

My attempt: 

&#x200B;

Let A,B, and C be three noncolinear points and E,F points that bisect AB and CB respectively. Extend EF through F to D such that EF=FD. Angle BFD = DFC so triangles BFE and DFC are congruent by SAS. We then choose P and Q on line AC such that PE and QF intersect EF at right angles. To finish the proof, we need to show that triangles EAP = DCQ. We know that EA = DC and can also show that angles AEP = CDQ. 

&#x200B;

But here is where I get stuck. If triangle AEP = CQD, angle EAP = DCQ. But PCQ is a straight angle and angle FCD = B. Then the congruence of the triangle would mean that in ABC, the sum of the angles is pi which is not true.

Only way I can see the -1 being a -2 is if I reduce the 2 radical 2 over 4 first which would leave me with plus/minus (sorry if I'm using the wrong term there) radical 2 over 2 and then divide the -4 by +2 = -2.

489,"How in the world do I get better at math, and learn to enjoy the subject?","Ever since I can remember, I've always been awful at math. I need a calculator for even the most basic things, Algebra was difficult in high school, and now Trig is giving me a lot of grief in college. For my major, I still will have to take stats and calc as well. Knowing how much I'm struggling with trig, I can't imagine either of those will be any easier.

That being said, what exactly can I do to fix this? I've tried all that I can think of. I study a lot, I try to watch KhanAcademy videos online, I ask tutors for help, I do practice problems and quizzes too.

493,[Calculus 1] Got two limits to infinity wrong,"In this post when I'll say lim it will mean the limit as n it tends towards infinity.

I had some limits for my homework and I find them hard as hell. Eventually I did them with l'hopital's rule and I got the answer wrong. Worth noting that we didn't learn l'hopital's yet so they should be able to be solved without it and I'd like to know how. That's most likely also why I probably applied it wrong, lol.  

Solve: lim [ln(e^n + 1)/(n+1)]. The answer key says it's 1, and so does the desmos graph.

I solved it like this: It's a case of infinity over infinity so we can apply l'hopital. The derivative of the upper part is (e^n )/(e^n + 1) and of the lower part it's (e^n )/(e^(n+1) ).

We'll then get lim[(e^n + 1) / (e^(n+1) ). We can divide by e^n both parts and get lim[e/(1 + 1/(e^n ) )] which is e/(1+0) which is e. That's not 1. 

The second limit, solve: lim[ (4^n + 1)/(2^n + 3)]. It's inf/inf so we apply l'hopital again and get lim{ [(ln4 * 4^n )/(4^n + 1)] / [(ln2 * 2^n )/(2^n + 3)]. Distribute and we get

lim [ (ln4 * 4^n * 2^n  +  ln4 * 4^n * 3) / (ln2 * 2^n * 4^n + ln2 * 2^n ) ]. Divide by 4^n and we get

lim { [ln4 * 2^n + ln4 * 3] / [ln2 * 2^n + (ln2 * 2^n )/4^n ] }. Divide by 2^n and we get

lim { [ln4 + (ln4 * 3)/(2^n )] / [ln2 + ln2/4^n ] } 

That's equal to ln4/ln2. The answer key says the answer to this limit is 2 though.

And by square waves I mean the obvious substitutes. If f(x)=(1 if x≥0, -1 if x<0). The the square waves are just f(sin(nt)) and f(cos(nt)).

There might be issues due to the discontinuities of the square waves but I believe this might go away if we remember that elements of L^2 are equivalence classes and not functions. Either case is interesting.

I think the obvious way to prove this is attempting to write all trignometric monomials as a series of square waves.

For anyone that doesn't have imgur available to them, it asks me to find F'(x), where F(x) = integral[0 to sin(x)] of 7√(t)dt

7√(sinx)

Furthermore, if I want to find the closest number (rounded down) to, say 13 in the sequence, I would do:

    x = 13
    a = 1
    while a < x:
        a = 2 * a + 2

I have a lot of interests, most of them in creative fields, so I'm grateful for what I got out of college, and I'm currently pursuing a career as a creative entrepreneur.

Creating and Learning are two primary things in my life that I never want to stop doing. I've always been a self-learner and recently i started spending more time pushing myself to read regularly.

This past month, I read Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and it was super interesting. I've always had an interest in Physics, but only took one class in high school. I also took AP Calculus in high school, but it wasn't something I was particularly good at (I passed the class with a C+, but didn't pass the AP Exam). Either way, I'd love to have a deeper understanding in Physics and Math, so I'm starting a self-study project.

Obviously, I need to have the foundations down first, before I try to get into anything complicated. 

I'm currently going through: 

\- A Stanford course on Coursera by Dr. Keith Delvin called ""Introduction to Mathematical Thinking."" I just finished up Week 1. 

\- ""The Foundations of Mathematics"" by Ian Stewart and David Tall. I'm finishing up Chapter 2 on Number Systems. 

\- ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics."" I read Chapter 1 earlier. 

\- I'll probably take the ""Single Variable Calculus"" course on MIT's website after I finish ""Intro to Mathematical Thinking.""

By finding the eigenvalues of the matrix of q, the diagonal representation is q is u\^2+4v\^2. That of r stays the same, namely u'\^2+v'\^2+w'\^2. One could solve the problem by inserting one of the diagonal representations inside the other and minimise that expression.

Why is this possible? Aren't the diagonal representations based on two different basis, i.e. the basis of eigenvectors of q and r respectively, and so represent different coordinates, as the notation also indicates?

The minimum and maximum values of a quadratic form, with ascending eigenvalues indiced from 1 to n, is given by:

I do not want to just get those courses; this is in pursuit of a hobby/obsession that may or may not collide with some mathematical modeling later.

I am reading Ian Stewart's ""The Foundations of Mathematics"", that has been good but I would like a better foundation. I recently read ""The Mathematicians Lament"" by Lockhart and as he described my math education stunk. I am plowing through Khan Academy; it is good but not at the depth I would like.

The question is, I would really like to work through the course The Art of Problem Solving from Prealgebra through Calculus. However, I cannot seem to find those books cheaply available.

I struck out there, and the cheapest used online I could find was AbeBooks at $46. This is stiff for just the prealgebra book. I would need to be able to resell that at pretty close to what I paid to be able to float it, but textbook rentals do not seem to carry that title. So, short of piracy sites, what advice would you give?

I am drawn to AoPS since it uses the, ""let us get under the algorithm hood and understand why and how"" approach. Khan Academy has been fine for slogging through the experience I need just working the equations. If you suggest an alternative, great!

How many ways can 5 different people sit in a row of 20 chairs so that none of them sit next to each other?

The answer said it was 16 permute 5, and the explanation given was that the 5 people needed 4 chairs of space in between them to never sit adjacent to one another. Then, the problem is just ""How many ways can 5 different people sit in a row of 16 chairs""?

I am confused as to why this works since there would be cases where a person sitting in the middle would remove two possible chairs for future people (the chairs to the left and right of them). The maximum amount of ways is when people sit in the most efficient way to only remove one chair each time along with their own, which would be 20\*18\*16\*14\*12 ways.

646,"How do I overcome the limitations of textbooks and university courses in not preparing me to synthesize answers? [Undergraduate, Algebra]","[I was reviewing undergraduate abstract algebra](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/exercises-cyclic.html) using this book, and I was able to solve all of the exercises until I got to Exercise 4.13. Proving the orders for which a group of units is cyclic required knowledge that **wasn't** supplied in the chapter but I had to synthesize.

I later realized that generally speaking textbooks have failed at teaching me how to synthesize mathematical concepts into new information. And so have university professors. And all of my math teachers for the past 16 or whatever years of formal education I've received.

Now I can do **some** original synthesis for problem solving. For instance, I had to enumerate all of the factors of a number, and I did it by realizing that enumerating factors correspond to enumerating an n-digit number in base k... and then crossing out the impossible combinations. But this definitely isn't something I'm good at. But at least I can do it.

But the tides change when it comes to relying on theorems as opposed to the **concepts** behind the theorem. For instance, it is easy to prove the Chinese Remainder Theorem and then apply it to Exercise 4.13, but what about seeing the outlines of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the exercise and extracting the idea behind it, without relying on proving the whole theorem? In fact, unlike original synthesis, this is something I've never done successfully. I never learned how to see the concept of a theorem behind a problem.

**Therefore, f can be written such that f(x) = f(-x) + (-f(x)).**

You can calculate the limit to infinity of a_n. This is different from the limit to infinity of 1/n^2 , which is 0, because in the a_n I defined, *each element of the series is a sum*. So if b_n = 1/n^2 then the elements of b_n are {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...} whereas the elements of a_n are {1, 1.5, 1.75, 1.875, ...}

That is pretty clear to me. However the question I have is: is it the same thing to say that calculating the limit of a_n to infinity is the same thing as calculating to what the following sum converges: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... (which is 2)? Or are those two different things?

If they are the same then it means calculating convergent series is the same thing as calculating limits to infinity of a sum, which is interesting since I started doing the latter with the claw theorem in class even though I'm in what would be the equivalent of calculus 1 right now and I know that in the US they do convergent series in calc 1.

EDIT: I did some more thinking alone and I believe the answer is they're the same thing. Because looking back at what I wrote, it's clear that its limit to infinity is also 2 since the elements of it are literally {1, 1.5, 1.75, 1.875, ...} so as n tends towards infinity, a_n gets bigger and bigger but also never gets past 2.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dlyz70/is_the_limit_to_infinity_of_a_sum_the_same_as_the/

What I have done so far: I figured out that the number of possibilities for a hydra is represented by the Catalan sequence.

I also started with a more simplified version of the game - what if instead of generating a random finite number of new subtrees when cutting off a head, the hydra always generates 2? Hopefully this will make it easier, but I don't know where to go from here.

Also, how would you find the expected value of number of steps for the hydra to be killed?

671,hypothesis testing for machine learning model: Am I doing it right?,"I have build a machine learning model that tries to separate positive from negative samples.

The [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) looks like this:

\[\[1567   24\]

\[ 577   32\]\]

which  means: from 1591 negative samples 24 samples were falsely predicted as  positive and from 609 positive samples 32 were correctly predicted as  positive.

I want to test, if this model is better than a random guessing one, so my hypotheses would be

H0: the model is random guessing and has a chance p=0.27 of guessing correctly (577/(1567+577))

H1: the model is better than random guessing and has p>0.27

for my current approach I have used this [binomial probability calculator](https://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx) with the following values:

* probability of success on a single trial: 0.28
* Number of trials: 24+32 = 56

675,[Matrix/Linear Algebra] Why does this work when solving for an eigenvector?,"I was working on homework for the recent section from class (Eigenvectors/Eigenvalues) and had some trouble when reading this part of my textbook:

> The scalar λ is an eigenvalue of matrix A if and only if there is a nontrivial solution **x** of the equation:

> Ax = λx

> This is equivalent to the equation (A - λI)**x** = 0

I was trying to work out the steps between those two equations, and it made sense at first:

- Ax = λx
- Ax = λIx (Definition of the identity matrix)
- Ax - λIx = λIx - λIx
- Ax - λIx = 0
- (A - λI)x = 0

That all made sense on a basic level, but it's the part between those last two lines that was getting to me. By factoring out 'x' (the reason the identity matrix was allowed to be used), the term that would have been a scalar (λ) is now a vector (λ * I).

This makes sense on an algebraic level, because λ**x** is equivalent to (λI)**x** by value, but it just bothered me because I started wondering if a scalar is equivalent to its value times the identity matrix of the space it is being used in.

I knew that wasn't the case, but I'm just trying to put words this fact (that a scalar multiplied by a matrix now has the property itself of being able to be used as a matrix)

For example: If 5 people start an MLM and each of them recruits 5 people who recruit 5 more and so on by 5^14 or 14 ""steps"" you nearly hit the Earth's population. That is a simple equation I understand.

For a larger MLM who has 1000's of members already, it becomes far harder to succeed for new recruits. An example is if your MLM has 1000 members worldwide, if they all are told to recruit 30 people below them and those 30 people below them, how do I create an equation to show this? I know this would take a lot less steps than the scenario above, but how do I calculate it. Because you already start with 1000 people, but all new recruits after the 1000 are expected to bring in 30 new people, whilst the original 1000 are still recruiting. So how can I represent this?

I could just say 30^7 is over the Earth's population, but that leaves out the original 1000 people and the fact they are recruiting new people at the same time.

So I did cos(pix) and tan(pix) and go confuses as sin(pix) and tan(pix) are written the same way. That is to say, tan(pix)=sin(pix), which I knew is just not true. So I tried seeing if I could write other trig functions that were the same in product notation, and realized that there are infinite trig functions expressed the same in product notation. Why is this? Because sin(pix), tan(pix), and cos(pi(x+.5)) are not the same, but they are in product notation. Can someone help explain? Just to show the example, those 3 functions when written in product notation are 

pix(product(1-((x^2)/(n^2)))
Where product is capital pi from n=1 to infinity. 

Plz forgive me if I made a typo I’m bored in class on my phone 

Last thing, the only thing I can really think of as to why there are infinite functions expressed the same in product notation is that it focuses on the zeros of the function and since trig functions alternate you can write them infinitely many ways to get the zeros at the same place, even if other values aren’t the same.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dlpxq5/functions_as_products/

737,"I'm writing a Fantasy story with a multitude of incredibly powerful warriors as the antagonists, but I'm having trouble determining how many of the titular Dreadknights exist.","Okay, backstory time.

In my story, Dreadknights, the year was 2100 A.D. (or close to that time) when humanity has been driven into a vast shelter dug out 2 miles underground.

This shelter is known as The Terraplex, and its purpose is to give humanity the only chance to survive against the Niraut. The Niruat are a multitude of magical creatures created by Jazan, The Star God of Unholy Dreams, to wipe out all life on Earth and consume all of its energy.

But the Terraplex has another purpose, for just as Satan isn't in the ground in this universe, God wasn't in the sky. Gaia [Temporary Name], is rising from the Earth to give humanity a fighting chance against him, but Gaia knew that Jazan's assault was too fast for her to make it in time.

So Gaia instructed a number of human nations to build Terraplexes two miles under the surface so she may give them magic. The thing is that in order for a god to give a sentient creature magical abilities, they HAVE to appear before them in a body that can be touched. This is where the problem arises, Gaia is so entrenched in our world, and fueling life, that it'll take thousands of years for her to be close enough to the surface to do so. And by that time humanity would be long gone.

So she messaged several human nations to dig 2 miles underground and build the Terraplexes where they would wait until Gaia kept her promise and gave them magic. America's Terraplex was the only one able to be completed in time.

And so for 4,202 years, the human race has remained in the last city, Nova Sanctum, as a race of only 10,000 individuals, the Terraplex can sustain little above that.

A thousand years after they were sealed in, Gaia appeared and kept her promise, all of the humans of the Terraplex entered a pact with her that allowed them to use Gaia's power to do magic...and the descendants of those who made the pact, but Gaia knew this was not enough.

Nova Sanctum is surrounded by a vast desolate rocky cave filled with interconnected pools of water known as The Verge. Gaia gave the humans another commandment.

""When glowing marks spiralling all over your body appear, you will know that you are worthy of earning even greater power, the power needed to defeat the Niraut. When the marks appear, go into the verge and drown in the biggest of these pools of water, which I dub The Lake of Sublimity, and you when you emerge, you will be unharmed, unable to die from asphyxiation, will have great power and be beyond the ravages of time.""

But this power was not sufficient for the humans to succeed. Gaia levitated her physical form over The Lake of Sublimity, then turned into a pile of rocks and fell in the center, and the Lake of Sublimity, and every drop of water connected to it, was consecrated as Holy Water, lethal to the touch for all Niraut, but for the creatures of Earth it possesses unparalleled healing properties. Soon The Verge began to fill with life and became an ecosystem of glowing plants, fungi, and insects, but let's stop there.

There are 10,000 humans alive for that 3,202 years, and outside of that number there are only a thousand of the titular Dreadknights awake during that time. Whenever the number of Dreadknights reaches a certain point, 1,500, one hundred of the elder Dreadknights must enter the pools of holy water and sleep in it, there they will remain, perfectly preserved, awaiting the day they are called upon to retake the surface.

**Every 20 years, 100 Dreadknights on average are chosen from the general populace are declared worthy (marked), many from young children, and that number is spread out across those 20 years. So, how many Dreadknights would be created from a population of 10,000 during a time of 3,202 years, maximum and minimum?**

742,Why does projecting a circle through a circle give you a line?,"Okay, this question might sound very vague at first, but it comes from our second week problems for my Analysis class (It's Germany, so we don't call it real or complex analysis, it's both I believe)

The problem is: Draw the set of all numbers z with 1/z - 1/z* = 2 i.

z* being the conjugate of z

So, the way I went about is, first getting rid of the inverses and just imagining the set of z - z* = 2i. Which ends up being a line with z = x + i. So to put it in the x-y plane. y = 1.

Now, if you do some not so fancy algebra you can turn 1/z - 1/z* = 2i into x^2 + y^2 + y = 0 which is just a equation for a circle with center C(0|-0.5) r=0.5

Now, because of the way complex numbers get turned into it's inverse geometrically, this means that, if you:

1. Turn that circle upside down (Since that's what the inverse does at the end)

2. Multiply each z on the small circle by 1/|z|^2 you get the mentioned line. This is equal to multiplying it by 1/|z| once, putting it on the big circle, then again, putting it on the line.

Why does projecting the small circle through the bigger one like that create such a perfect a line?

 Is there any intuitive reason for it, or some bigger insight to be gained about the general nature of such projections?

757,[Differential Equations] Hard problem - Minimize the time needed for exponential to beat linear.,"I denote functions by capital letters and constants by small.

The gist of it is that have a y and I want it to increase as fast as possible. But how?

The easy problem: 

Say y is a function of time y(t), with t≥0, controlled by a differential equation. It either increases linearly or exponentially, ie either it increases at a constant rate or it increases proportionally to itself, and say I can tune which is given a greater preference. I do that by chosing a parameter r(t). But r(t) can only take values in [0,1]. Formally:

y'=Ar+By(1-r)+C, y(0)=0, (where y and r are functions of time)

If we want to increase y as fast as possible at t, we'll just choose r(t)=1 or r(t)=0, it's a matter of whether (A\*1 + By\*0 + C ) > (A\*0 + By\*1 + C) or not. Therefore we'll say y is linear dominated at t if  (A\*1 + By\*0 + C ) ≥ (A\*0 + By\*1 + C), else it's exponential dominated. Obviously y will always start as linearly dominated but that will quickly change.

Problem: Choose the r(t) that minimizes the time at which y becomes exponential dominated.

Solution: Simply choose r(t)=1 and y will become exponential dominated when (A\*1 + By\*0 + C ) < (A\*0 + By\*1 + C) of course.

The hard problem:

So before we're incentivized to bet purely on the linear behavior. But what if the longer you favor the linear behavior the better the exponential behavior gets? Ie:

y'=Ar+By(1-r)\***s**+C, y'(0)=0

s'=Er, s(0)=0, where E is a constant 

**Problem:** Chose r(t) that minimizes the time it takes for y to become exponentially dominated, ie for (A\*1 + By\*0**s**  + C ) < (A\*0 + By\*1**s** + C)

PS: I tried to write the solution y semi-explicitly, and then do a variational approach by varying r infinitesimally but the expression becomes too large for me to handle. Also I haven't even solved the problem for if r was constant.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dlhi8j/differential_equations_hard_problem_minimize_the/

760,[Differentiation] Finding the minimum of a function,"So I've come across this question in a maths assignment, and I'm beginning to believe there might have been a typo:

A manufacturer wants to produce 1/2 litre plastic containers that are open at the top from as small a quantity of plastic as possible.

* A = pi(R)^2 + 1000/(R)

761,Math Riddle,"I was trying to solve the following math problem from fivethirtyeight(link in the end of the post):

&#x200B;

Last week, there was an auditorium with 200 seats, numbered from 1 to 200 and filled to capacity. A speaker overlooking the audience said: “I’m thinking of a rather large whole number. Every seat number in this auditorium evenly divides my number, except for two of them — and those two seats happen to be next to each other.” Which two numbers was the speaker referring to?

&#x200B;

I am having problems with understanding this part of the solution:

&#x200B;

""Solver Jenny Mitchell made a key realization: Since every seat number, other than the two excluded numbers, had to evenly divide the large mystery number, **those two excluded numbers both had to be the largest powers of primes smaller than the total number of seats** (which was 200). And because the two seats were consecutive, that meant that one of them had to be even, and therefore a power of 2. The largest power of 2 that’s smaller than 200 is 27, or 128. That must be one of the two seat numbers.""

&#x200B;

Is there any explanation or rigorous proof of this fact? It seems to be so simple, but I am certainly missing something to convince myself that this is true. Any help would be highly appreciated

767,[University Statistics] Probability within EU4,"To begin with, I don't know if this is the right place to post this but everyone has seemed so helpful to other people's questions that it seemed right. But please feel free to send me somewhere else if that would be more appropriate, but here goes: 

So I was playing Europa Universalis 4 (EU4) and started wondering about the probabilities behind the raising of rebels. For those who don't know, EU4 is a 'historic simulation' game where you take on a country/nation from the 15th to 19th centuries and part of the game is dealing with rebels of varying sorts: separatists, nobles, peasants, clergy, etc., though understanding this isn't really relevant to the math involved.

What *is* relevant is that rebels only spawn when a counter has reached 100%. Every month in the game, there is a certain chance (which for my specific incidence is 15.3%) that the counter will go up by 10%. The in-game mathemagic then provides you with a general idea of how long it will be before you see rebels popping up in territories.

As for my question, I'm curious in how this is calculated. I have some experience with probability, but it's been a while since I've had to do much with it (and I was never that good to begin with lol) so where I'm at is:

-They're calculating an expected value
-There's a 15.3% chance that the counter will increase by 10% every month (meaning an 84.7% chance of it staying the same)
-From that there's an .847^(n) - where n is the number of months - of it not increasing *per counter*.

But that's about it. I can't figure out where to go from here and, even if I did, I don't know if I could explain why.

769,Binary with alternate place values,"Normally, binary number place values are powers of two:

A = {8, 4, 2, 1}

Ten is 1010, or eight plus two. But if you do your math mod 16, other place values work. Not all, but some. One pattern that works is repeatedly doubling a number coprime to the modulus, like 3:

B = {24, 12, 6, 3} ≡ {8, 12, 6, 3} mod 16

Ten has a different representation now, but you can still write it as 1110, or 24 + 12 + 6 mod 16. In fact, you can represent *every* value from 0 to 15, and each value has a unique representation.

Another way to think about being able to represent every value uniquely: A -> B defines a mapping 1010 -> 1110 (and so on for the other bit patterns), and this mapping is a permutation. This particular mapping is equivalent to multiplying by 3 mod 16, which must be a permutation [because if 3 is coprime to 16, it must have an inverse mod 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity). But there are other permutations that don't have a simple mathematical transform:

C = {3, 8, 4, 14} mod 16

C was found by trial-and-error by computer, and it also can be used to uniquely write any value from 0 to 15: you can write ten as 0111, eleven as 1100, etc. Or in permutation speak, A -> C maps 1010 -> 0111 and 1011 -> 1100.

The pattern with C is less clear, but there is one: each element of C, when written in traditional binary representation, has a different number of trailing zero bits. I can see how that's sufficient for invertibility when the modulus is a power of two (and invertibility implies a permutation), but I'm not 100% sure it's a necessary condition.

D = {7, 1, 3, 5} mod 10

D was also found by trial-and-error, and is an example of extending this to moduli that aren't powers of two. *If you only consider the first ten bit patterns*, A -> D defines a permutation:

- 0000 -> 0000
- 0001 -> 0100
- 0010 -> 1001
- 0011 -> 0010
- 0100 -> 0110
- 0101 -> 0001
- 0110 -> 0101
- 0111 -> 1000
- 1000 -> 0011
- 1001 -> 0111

This is one that I'm still trying to understand. For B and C I can figure out the pattern, the reason *why* the pattern produces a permutation. For D, I can't figure out why, and ""it just works by luck"" doesn't satisfy me.

I would appreciate any help or suggestions!

Specifically, I'm not thinking of something as difficult as Strang's Linear Algebra (which is the de facto textbook for undergrad linear algebra), and possibly not even as hard as Friedberg, Incel and Spence's book either (she has already seen it, and thinks it is too abstract.)

I am looking for a book that is not totally mind-numbing boring to give a college sophomore who can already compute matrix multiplications and determinants, but doesn't yet understand what they mean. They have also never seen a proof-based course outside of discrete mathematics.

Note #1:  I am specifically looking for a book with problems for her to do; it's a cop-out to link 3Blue1Brown's series on Linear Algebra. That series is highly visually intuitive, and she has already seen quite a bit of it, but I feel that it lacks the proof-y ness to build some solid abstract intuition.

Note #2:

When I was studying linear algebra myself, I first jumped into Friedberg's book then Strang's book and it did take quite a bit of time to rebuild the intuition in an abstract context. I am looking for a gentler introduction than Friedberg's 1000000 proof book, which scares her because it is essentially a book of all proofs, stacked on top of one another.

After finding the radius of the cylinder + cone using calculus. This should allow me to find the height and therefore, the minimum surface area of this composite shape. However, it was only today that my teacher told me that, the height of the cylinder and cone are **not** the same. 

Therefore, I was wondering is there a way to find the height of both the cylinder and cone, to allow the shape to have a minimum surface area. 

If the height of both shapes are different, would this have an effect on the previous equation used to find the surface area, which is: πr√(h^(2) + r^(2)) + 2 πrh + πr^(2).

If this changes the formula, then the radius would also be different, which makes it confusing to know, what to do now.

The two problems that really stumped me were: prove every open connected subset of the plane is path connected and prove every continuous bijection f:R to R is a homeomorphism.

For the first one I only got as far as the intuition that every point has a neighborhood that is clearly path connected, but I was not sure how to translate that into a statement about the whole subset. For the second I thought about using the fact that continuous images of compact sets are compact, but I wasn't sure of how to translate that into something about an unbounded subset of the plane.

I'm pretty confident in my answers for the two questions on the test that were proved in class, but maybe I made some careless mistakes there as well.

So for something like this, [https://imgur.com/a/PEB37Ua](https://imgur.com/a/PEB37Ua) , I am seeking a general approach. It's hard to just pick a curve and follow it to see if the field is conservative because I am not sure which curve to pick. If we look at the outer box going clockwise, however, the top and bottom cancel. But the left and right sides do not, right? So not conservative?

I know how to do part (a), but for part(b), I'm very confused due to the parameterization stuff. I really don't know how to approach this at all. I know I have to get things in terms of t, and since it involves a cylinder, there will also be some cos(t) sin(t) stuff, but I don't know how to approach it.

Lastly, there was another question that caught me super off guard: [https://imgur.com/a/liSuuQl](https://imgur.com/a/liSuuQl) . I know how to do part (a), but the other 2 parts are really strange. (part b) In lecture, we learned about how to tell if something is conservative: 1) if the partial derivatives of the x and y component are equal (exactly what the dP/dy = dQ/dx is saying), and 2) independence of path. So I can see that curve A and C start and end at the same point yet their integrals are -1 and 2, which made me think its not conservative(the right answer) because they are path dependent. But then why is it that the statement dP/dy = dQ/dx is true, doesn't that make the field conservative? (part c) And as for the last part, I am just lost and have no clue where to even start. In examples similar to the that of my original post, I would just do f(B) - f(A), but we don't have a contour plot this time to give us that information.

Can anyone help me with these two logic problems here please?

For the second one I know 2 of them are wrong, but I can't seem to figure out which. My thoughts for each one are below. 

1. True, let x = n and y = 1-n, then x + y = 1

2. False, no values satisfy this equation because addition is commutative

3. False, No real number satisfies this equation, x^2 must always be positive.

4. Not sure about this one, is the ""∃"" operator exclusive?. I said this one is true, is this correct or is it false because 2 has two square roots in ℝ?

5. True, let x = n, y = 1/n, n ∊ ℝ. Then n * 1/n = 1 thus xy = 1

6. This has to be true because z will always be defined for any value of x and y, if it were 2/(x+y) then it would be false because there would be values of x and y for which z is undefined.

7. I think this is true but again not sure about the exclusivity of the ∃ operator (see point 4)

8. Pretty sure this is true, could prove the same way as number 5.

9. This is definitely false, can prove graphically (they are parallel lines) or by system of equations showing there is no value that solves both of those equations.

10. True for x = 0, any number multiplied by 0 is 0

11. True but honestly not sure how to explain it

12. I think this one is false, if I try to prove both sides of the and statement it does not work.
To prove the x + y = 2 statement I did x = n, y = 2-n, then x + y = 2. This only works for the second statement if n = 1. Since this does not hold for every x then it is false.

I'm really struggling with the first one, I've made a few attempts at it but can't seem to get it right.
I think I have the first part right but I'm really struggling with the negation in the other two. If someone could give me a hint that would be great (but I will need you to confirm if I have it correct because I'm down to my last attempt on that problem)

But what are the chances that at least one of the events will occur? It's obviously not 80%, since that would mean a 50/50 chance would equal a 100% chance for the event to occur.

&#x200B;

For example: i have 2 lighters, and each lighter has a 40% chance to ignite a flame when i click one of the lighters. What is the chance that at least one of the lighters will ignite a flame if i click both lighters once, and why? (clicking both lighters should still be counted as 1 event in my example, just the probability should be higher since its 2 lighters, but i don't know how to calculate that).

&#x200B;

thank you in advance!

Edit: another example would be I have 2 dices and there's a 1/6 chance to roll a 3 on a dice. But what are my chances to roll at least one 3 with 2 dices?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dkdfd1/understanding_probability_for_2_independent_events/

923,"Help with proof from Sedgewick's ""Graph Algorithms"" book: Prove that any acyclic, connected graph with V vertices has V-1 edges?","I'm self-studying Robert Sedgewick's book *Algorithms in Java: Part 5 - Graph Algorithms (3rd ed)*, and am looking for a sanity check (and possibly some help) on Exercise 17.1. The exercise asks:

> Prove that any acyclic, connected graph with V vertices has V-1 edges.

Superficially this seems to follow so directly from the definitions / conditions stated earlier in the chapter, that I'm not sure what a ""proof"" would even constitute here (if I were doing this in a class). 

The definitions tell us:

> An acyclic, connected graph is called a tree

> A graph G with V vertices is  a tree iff any of the following:

> G has V-1 edges and is acyclic

> G has V-1 edges and is connected

> snip

> Any one of these conditions is necessary and sufficient to prove the others

Given that, it seems almost to be ""by definition"" that an acyclic, connected graph with V vertices has V-1 edges.

I suspect that something more is really being sought here, and the best I've come up with so far is something like this:

1. For a connected, acyclic graph with V vertices, each vertex needs one edge to even be part of the graph at all. This would appear to leave us needing V edges.
2. But at least one vertex is the other side of a vertex pair, so subtract ""its edge"". That leaves V-1 edges.
3. The graph is connected by definition in the problem so there is now a path from any vertex to any other
4. Adding any additional edge now would create a cycle since the graph is already connected

Thoughts? Am I going about this all wrong? If so, any pointers or hints would be appreciated.  Note: I don't have a background in writing proofs, so please be gentle. I have a vague notion that the major proof strategies are ""deductive  proof"" following from definitions, ""proof by contradiction"" and ""proof by induction"" but I'm pretty inexperienced here, especially with the latter two approaches.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dkd1p9/help_with_proof_from_sedgewicks_graph_algorithms/

927,Math Professors- How to ask for help?,"(Crossposting from r/askacademia, incase anyone here has some input, as this definitely still pertains to learning math)

Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I'm in a bit of an uncomfortable and disheartening situation and I'm looking for some advice on how best to proceed. This is a bit of a long read, so I'm sorry, but I'm feeling extremely, extremely discouraged and would like some honest input from capable individuals in the field. I would post to the professors sub, but I'm not certain they'd like another student invading their virtual lounge without invitation, so hopefully here will work? I really need some help.

Alright, so,

I'm currently a first-year undergraduate student in the math and physical sciences stream of my university (first-years do not yet have formal programs, but are instead in one of several streams of study, they apply to programs at the end of their first-year).

My university experience has been a trying one thus far. I was admitted with a nice scholarship upon application and was supposed to have been a third-year student by now, but due to mental and physical health issues, I ended up taking an incomplete courseload my first official year, then having to take a leave of absence the second, and only now am I back, and still a first year.

I'm now properly registered with the accessibility services at my school, and at their advice and that of academic advisors, am starting with a partial courseload to try to learn how to be a functioning student and individual (living on my own for the first time). And, really, until yesterday evening, I was doing pretty okay. My mental health is very much Not Good, and I'm waiting on specialists and doing things in the meantime to try to sort things out, but things are difficult. I have a lot of difficulty with executive functioning skills. Despite this, I am doing exceptionally well in my language course, and was doing well in my math course. Keyword being was.

The math course that I'm in is the one designated for students who have an interest in math, but aren't certain they wish to pursue it, or are in the physical or computer sciences, or who may not have the necessary prerequisite knowledge/maturity to take the higher-level math course. Our first term test was yesterday, and it covered introductory logic, notation, quantifiers, formal limits, continuity, epsilon-delta proofs, and things of that sort. I did really well on the assignments prior to this test. They were a little challenging, but given time and the ability to ask questions, I performed very very well and thought I understood the material reasonably well. I've been going to office hours, speaking with my professor after lectures, and double-checking that my proofs are well-written and that my approaches are correct. My relationship with math has been difficult in the past, mostly because of the disappointing math curriculum and teaching standard where I live; students are taught to memorize and never question why or how things work and that led me to a lot of frustration. Despite never doing poorly in my math classes, I feel like my foundational math is not as solid as it could be, that I never really did as well as I could, and that maybe I still have some unresolved emotional issues there. But, for the first time, as I began this course and saw how capable and enthusiastic my instructors are, as I started to find the content interesting and even enjoyable (epsilon delta proofs are like satisfying little puzzle mini-games!) and doing well I began to think that maybe, just maybe, I could be good at this. Maybe I could be a math student. Maybe.

But then the term test came yesterday, and wow. I don't even know what to say. I did all the practice problems, reviewed all the videos, did the tutorials, clarified my questions, and thought things would hopefully be fine. All the signs suggested things would be fine. Then I started the test, and it may as well have been written in Inuktitut. I could hardly make sense of anything. I couldn't remember how to prove statements, how to reason through rough work. Determining limits of compositions from a graph?? How does that work? I was so anxious I could hardly think and I honestly cannot tell you whether I failed that test or by some miracle pulled and 80 or something, and I don't know when we'll have our marks back. I don't even want to look at it when we do get it back. I feel physically ill about my performance on this test. I spent a good amount of time crying last night.

I have to be honest and say that I'm not used to doing poorly, or to have any significant struggle understanding things. Courses like biology and chemistry and everything else have come easily and intuitively and despite having arguably one of the worst periods of my life at the time, I still managed to finish with above 95 in them. But math.... I feel so slow. So stupid. So abysmally stupid. Things don't come as quickly, in fact, they come quite slowly. Too slowly. I did really well on the problem sets but now I'm just wondering if I faked my way into that, because apparently I don't understand that much at all, if that test was anything to go by. Maybe I'm incapable of doing things on my own. I don't even know if it will be possible for me to finish with above a 90 in this course now (which, while I recognize that grades are not necessarily the most important qualifier or anything, I would like to pursue some form of graduate schooling so a decent academic record is preferable).

Just last week my professor was telling me they'd be happy to speak to me more about pursuing math, and we were maybe starting to develop a slightly friendlier relationship, and now, I don't think I can even look them in the eye. I must seem so stupid. It's worth questioning whether I even belong in this course. I know that they say math is a discipline where hard work surpasses talent, but even then, I think natural aptitude is important to some degree, and I'm starting to question whether I actually have any. How can I even ask them for help when just last week I was dumb enough to admit I was just slightly considering math?

I'm tired of running away from my failures throughout the past couple of years though, so I really want the chance to repair this. If only out of stubbornness, I want the opportunity to conquer this material and understand it, to devour it until it becomes like breathing and maybe give math the chance I never truly gave it before. The chance I didn't give myself before. I intend to speak to my professor on Monday and ask for help or guidance, but I don't know how to go about doing so. What do I tell them? How much do I tell them? I feel like whatever potential I had when I was younger shriveled up and died the day my mental health decided it was time to mutate. I'm already a disappointment and I don't know whether to be honest about my past here. No one knows except the relevant counselors and advisors here and it's kind of isolating, but probably for the best? I really wanted to develop a good relationship with this professor, maybe impress them on some minute level, to not just be some random student sitting in the lecture hall. But really I'm scared that they'll think I'm actually, certifiably stupid. I'm still nervous to ask them questions when there is something I don't quite fully grasp, to answer their questions and be wrong. I thought about speaking to one of the other course professors instead, who I'm less nervous around (might be better so that I can actually ask questions??) but this is the one for my lecture section, and they're a very impressive individual and I want to learn everything I can from them. I just don't want to be stupid or a disappointment or annoyance.

So yeah.

I might like math, I might not, I might not be adept at it, but I want the chance to be. Given my previous decent performance and likely disastrous test, how do I approach my professor who I'm kind of intimidated by? Just going up to them and being like ""Hi that test was a dumpster fire please take me under your wing and teach me everything you know"" is probably a bit much to dump on someone I've known for less than two months when I don't even know whether I should be studying math.

I'm really sorry this is so long, but I think I'm having a moderately-sized crisis so.

932,[Question] Yahtzee dice probability,"When playing the game Yahtzee players try to get certain configurations of five 6-sided dice. One of the options is a full house, which consists of three of one number and two of another. Another option is a three of a kind.

**Situation**: You have five dice in front of you, let's say they are 2 2 1 1 5. 

**Option 1, Three-of-a-kind**: You keep the two 2's and roll the 1 1 and 5 and attempt to get another 2 to make a 3-of-a-kind. Each of those three dice you rolled (1, 1, & 5) would individually have a 1/6 chance of becoming a 2.

**Option 2, Full House**: You keep the two 2's and the two 1's and only roll the 5 in an attempt to get either a 1 or a 2. This single dice you are rolling has a 1/3 chance of become a 1 or a 2. 

**QUESTION**: So my question is, which option has the higher probability of occuring? Logic tells me rolling one dice with a 1/3 chance is better than rolling three dice each with a 1/6 chance. However, my engineer brother tells me that I am wrong, but can't show me how I'm wrong.

First post, first question, first everything. Hope y'all can help and vice versa with other questions... This is the question verbatim from my text:

**Show that only those points satisfying y - y1 = m (x - x1) can lie on the line L1 passing through P1(x1, y1) with slope ""m"".**

Furthermore, I can demonstrate that a second line (L2) can have a slope equal to the slope of L1, but at a different pair of Ps in the plane. L1 || L2 if and only if L1 and L2 have equal slopes and the pairs of Ps defining the lines L1 and L2 are unique from each other.

I want to do a simulation/calculation of the changing perspective of an average healthy human eyesight for my school project and I'm interested in it as well outside of school.

**Heres an example of what I look for:**

We have a round disc for example, with a diameter of 1m., facing towards us at eye-height. Any curvature of earth put by side. The disc is located 5m. in front of us. The disc begins to move backward, and therefore away from us. The distance gets bigger, and the disc appears smaller and smaller.

My question is:

How can I calculate at what distance the disc will completely vanish out (vanishing point) of our sight?

So that I could do a calculation with new variables like randomly putting in different proportions. Like:

Disc with 1m. or 500m. or 500km of diameter. *And therefore get the distance needed to lose it out of sight*. Sure, the bigger the object, the bigger the distance needed, so how can I do this?

""if d = X amount of diameter. --> x searched = \*needed distance to disappear\* ""

""Extra"" question: (not needed, just interesting)

How do I calculate an example like a sheet of paper, with several circles drawn? One circle with 2cm. diameter and another with 0,5cm. diameter on the paper.

I just learned a rather neat mathematical card trick and I wanted to see if anyone here can figure out how this is done or if there is more than one reason why this trick works. I'm also curious to see if anyone else here has heard of this trick or understands how it works truly because I will admit my knowledge is lacking and for those curious aswell it may give you a fun problem to solve this week. Here is how the trick goes:

1. shuffle a 52 card deck (no jokers) to your satisfaction
2. place the top card on the table face-up, if it is an Ace, or a face card place it back somewhere randomly in the deck. If not then looking at the number on the card place cards face down on that first card to equal 12. (ex: if you drew a 2 then place 10 individual cards face down on that 2, if you drew a 6 place 6 individual cards face down on that 6 if you drew a 9 place 3 individual cards down on that 9, etc.)
3. Repeat step 2 creating a new pile every time you hit 12 until you begin a pile and run out of cards before reaching 12. gather up that partial pile and set it to the side, those are your extras and you will need them later.
4. Flip all the piles upside down so that all but the original card are facing up with the original card on top face down.
5. add up all of the numbers listed on the original cards to find their sum (ex: the original cards are as follows 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. you have two leftover cards. Those 3's add up to 30, therefore, the sum of the original cards is 30)
6. Using the number of piles you were able to make and the number of leftover cards you have you should be able to find the sum of the original cards, let's see if anyone can figure out how it's done.

I wish you all luck and I hope sincerely that I succeed in stumping a few of you for a bit and give you something fun to do or a fun problem to solve. (Note: feel free to message me or leave questions in the form of comments about the problem itself as you are trying to solve it. If me answering your question is too large of a portion of the answer in my opinion, if I can't answer it (as in I do not know the answer to your question) or if you simply ask me how this trick works my only response will be ""Sorry, I can't answer that"".

In order to solve this problem, you will need a deck of cards as well as a calculator to ensure your work is correct. REMEMBER: GOOGLING IS CHEATING (since this trick can be found online in a few variations and adapted, however using common knowledge or your own prior knowledge is encouraged). IF you find the answer, please do not comment on the answer itself. DM me the answer and I will tell you if you are right or wrong and if your work is right or wrong. Once again, good luck and have fun!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dk0kid/just_a_little_challenge_for_anyone_that_wishes_to/
990,[Elementary Linear Algebra] Population Movement,"Hi, I have a question where I need to calculate a population migration from 2002 to 2003 but the current population given is for 2003 . 

Here is the question - https://imgur.com/a/p8Q5xEv

I have read many article and ebooks and I think I can use Markov matrix for this but I am lost right now. Most question ask you to calculate for the coming year but not the past so I dont know how do I go from here. 

If there is a great tutorial or example for this I would be fantastic. Thank you for reading.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/dk01gb/elementary_linear_algebra_population_movement/

I’ve been stuck with the following problem:

[Problem](https://imgur.com/a/gzZz5Ep)

In the figure, ABCD is a trapezoid of bases AB and CD. P is midpoint of CE. If the areas of the regions DFC and AEPF are 3 and 21, respectively, then the area of the trapezoid AECD is:

I’ve only managed to discover that DCP and PBE are congruent and DCF and ABF are similar, but I didn’t get any useful information.

 sin(2x+2y)

So I understand that you first need to find the value for sinx, siny, cosx and cosy  to fill the equation  sin(2x+2y)= sin2ycos2x+sin2xcos2y but im not sure how the 2 will change my values, could someone please explain?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/djw5xd/trigonometry_help/

I honestly have no idea how they got this. I am trying to take the series expansion around x, and then trying to set A as 0. 

I honestly only need the first term.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/djuxt4/taylor_series_expansion_im_just_unsure_how/
